I had absolutely no idea one could build a telescope of this size and scale at home, but this is awesome! Just, like whoa, incredible, man.

Also if you're interested in building a scope check out /r/atming, have posted some good resources there too

I really want to stress that anybody, and I mean *anybody*, can do this! Telescope making and astronomy are no harder than building a PC and look how many folks do that!

Okay, some more edits since this is pretty visible:

* HIGHLY recommend joining your local astronomy club. Even if you can't physically visit right now there are still tons of great resources you can access and folks you can meet! Plus a lot of clubs can really use the cash - astro is kinda a niche hobby!

* This scope is NOT usable for astrophotography. Isn't designed to be.

* Over 197,000 upvotes - thank you all so much!

* I am speaking at the Black Forest Star Party in Coudersport, PA about telescope making in September. Register here: https://bfsp.org/ - will also be at the Cherry Springs Star Party at the same location in June, as well as Stellafane in August and potentially the Oregon Star Party in July and Peach State Star Gaze in October.

* Thanks for the gold and awards, kind strangers!

Again, TYSM everyone!
---------
".. bigger than the scope at my local observatory."

That's a pretty damn good science flex if I ever saw one.

Edit: My first award, thanks stranger! But if anyone feels like they want to give any awards, give it to the man of the post because he definitely deserves it!
---------
You're telling me that the person who runs the best telescope review site on the web and who writes the r/telescopes recommendations, as well as builds their own amazing telescopes, is only 17?!
---------
When I was your age I made a sims plumbob out of green paper and wire.

Your creation is far more impressive. Be proud!
---------
This really inspires me to be more productive during quarantine...
---------
Thinking back on it, I’m not sure I’ve ever actually used a telescope.
---------
That's the coolest most inspiring thing I have seen on Reddit today, rock on dude.
---------
I am 66 and had a good shit this morning...thats my idea of success these days...good luck to you Son...I hope there is a world in the future for you to enjoy..
---------
When I was 17 I was building gravity bongs out of old milk jugs.  We are not the same.
---------
I'm almost 30 and I taped a stick to another stick to reach the itch on my back.
---------
Sweeeeeet! Congrats young man. I have scope envy. Are you into astrophotography?
---------
Flex a bit more. Send the pic to Ford Motor Company. Scholarship or a new car could come your way! (Shhh, flip it).
---------
You are by far the coolest nerd I’ve ever seen.

Keep up the good work man,   The world needs people like you!
---------
So cool!! Where do you get one of these bad boys?
---------
You should do an AMA. You seem to have a pretty fascinating and full life. Telescope is really rad!
---------
Nice socks, I have like 2 dozen pairs of them and they’re super comfy.
---------
Absolutely magnificent! Cheers to you, young lad. We shall watch your career with great interest.
---------
How long did it take to build? I know nothing about telescope building but since you posted some cool links I may get into it; seems like something I’d enjoy.
---------
I always think I’m a pretty big nerd and then guys like this come around and remind me that I’m not really a nerd, I’m just uncool.
---------
First week of quarantine...

Builds amazing telescope

What are you gonna accomplish in the next 6-24 months of downtime???

Amazing !!!
---------
As a fellow 17 year old, my respect for you is immeasurable
---------
That’s awesome man. 

What do you think about starlink effecting amateur astronomers?
---------
Physicist here. Hope you’re planning on pursuing Astro/astrophysics. If so, I bet I’ll be reading about you one day. If not, whatever field you choose will be lucky to get you. 

Outstanding.
---------
That’s so impressive! Youre going to be doing amazing things! Congrats man that’s so awesome!!!
---------
Is this viral marketing for the inevitable Teenage Sheldon show?
---------
Im 30 years old and made a pancake today that was just to die for.
---------
Damn son, leave some pussy for the rest of us.
---------
If you’re not documenting all of this in your Engineering Portfolio yet, you should start immediately.
---------
Respect - well done, man. 

Any chance you can build ventilators? Like **a lot** of them?
---------
This is amazing, you are a badass, I'm in awe.
---------
I wish I had been this cool when I was 17. That's fucking bad ass.
---------
Nice job. That's a very fast mirror. How are you correcting for coma in the off-axis field? Do you have an pre-eyepiece corrector?
---------
This is really uplifting. I am truly amazed! Remember - sky is not the limit ;)
---------
I’m 17 and I just learnt how to make macaroni n cheese
---------
Dude please I beg of u save some pussy for the rest of us
---------
Fuck yeah. Great job dude. Now go fuck all the nerd ladies.
---------
And here I am 28 and struggling to finish my bachelor's while trying not to die in apex legends
---------
This kid accomplished more before he was an adult and than I will in my entire life.
---------
I genuinely congratulate you on your telescope, it’s a very difficult feat and it must’ve been stressful putting it together!
Enjoy it!


However, and I don’t think I can put this more bluntly, I don’t give a shit about your age, and I don’t think others should either. Age != intelligence, you can be 15 and smarter than most 45 year olds. It seems pretty stupid to focus on the fact you’re 17 rather than the massive accomplishment you actually did....

Sorry about the ranty comment, I’m just sick of the: “ I’m X years old” type posts...

Congratulations once again!
---------
I'm 18 years old and I'm going to dropout college next year
---------
This is extremely impressive and you're 17 years old. You have a bright future ahead of you my dude.
---------
You're amazing man! What sparked your curiosity for telescopes, space, and astronomy? What got you into it?
---------
This is freaking awesome you built that??!?! You sir are my new hero. I’ve got a hand me down telescope, nothing like what you built, that I’ve been trying to fix and use. I’m almost done but I’m missing a specific lens that is apparently no longer made? It’s an “antique” telescope but by antique I mean it’s from the 60s. It’s huge. Not the kind of telescope hobbyists would have invested in. 

Anyway all I’m missing is one lens and if you can make your own entire set up? I think I maybe can make my own lens to fit. 

Thanks for posting this! I feel inspired. 

Seriously and  I’m not messing with you. Seeing your post has genuinely inspired me to not drop my project. Thankyou!
---------
I just dinged 60 in WoW when I was 17... Today I dinged 60 on my alt...

But nice work! Would love to see some pictures from this bad boy :D
---------
But can you see why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
---------
How would an average Joe even begin to go about building a telescope from scratch let alone this size? I'm jelly and impressed to say the least and I'm a decade older too
---------
Hope you busting open as much pussy as you are these stars king
---------
Dude you frickin rock! I got my first reflector telescope when I was 17! Though i didn't make it myself haha.
---------
I played Doom and made Beef Rouladen today, so I'm something of a scientist myself.
---------
How much did this cost you to build? And where can one find a parts list?
---------
Not only do I envy your skill. I envy the Karma you got from this post and its comments.
---------
I’m 17 too and I really want one but I don’t have the money :(
---------
Man you are an amazing human.. damn we are some pretty cool apes ahahahaha
---------
[u/\_\_Augustus\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__Augustus_/) Do you have schematics for this? I'm no astrologist but I'd love to know how it works and if its a possibility to build my own!
---------
Leave some pussy for the rest of us. Don't hoard. Wtf.
---------
I'm 34 years old and I finally got around to taking down my Christmas lights.
---------
I’m 32 years old. I broke down and cried because I messed up putting up a backsplash tile
---------
I’ve never seen so many Reddit awards on a sub before. To build a stronger telescope that the local observatory, you earn them!
---------
Quarantine really brings out the best in people huh
---------
Dude...

Chill.

Save some women for the rest of us jeez
---------
Wooooow!  You are the kind of person Elon Musk is looking for!
---------
That’s very impressive. I hope your goals with this tool.
---------
I saw this in make magazine back in 2015 and always planned on making one, but just never found the time and energy so congratulations to you!
---------
Day 6 of quarantine this guy has built a telescope and all I've done is watch Netflix
---------
High school wont be your years kid. College though, you'll be known as the Newtonian pipe layer.
---------
Two questions 
First : how much cost to build this awesome telescope ?
 Second : any recommendation for first telescope for total noob ?
---------
Never start off by sharing your age. Your accomplishments will speak for themselves. Let others infer your age and be amazed when they realize the truth. Good work on your telescope!
---------
Why do men like this all have this same posture?
---------
At that age i used to check my horoscope.
Way to Go OP. Good luck for the future

Wow OP, that's a lot of shitposting on /r/the_donald in your post history. I don't think you're a very good person.
---------
Someone call nasa and tell them to check this out
---------
Good for you kid. Find what you like and apply yourself. Keep at it.
---------
You're killing it kid! With those skills at such a young ags, the galaxy is your oyster!
---------
Beautiful mind! There is still hope for us humans while there are 17 y.o. boys like you!
---------
This kid at 17: builds insanely powerful telescope by himself.

Me at 17: furiously masturbating in the shed to old Playboy magazines my brother left when he joined the military.
---------
This was his final picture before he drowned in puss
---------
Is that a 14.7" telescope or are you just happy to see me?
---------
Guy wants special treatment cause he’s 17. I see a one trick pony .
---------
Well done sir. I built a 6inch Newton in reflector with a dobson base about 28 years ago. Sadly it is in bad shape but I still have it.
Was this from scratch or was a it a DIY kit ?Edit never mind I read further
---------
Awesome job! Had been thinking about building myself but my problem is that im living in an area with too much light polution (Netherlands) so anything that I want to use myself needs to be portable for me to take it in the field a couple of KMs from here. Building myself would/will be a major accomplishment and a long time thing to cross of my to-do/bucket list. Again, you did a great job.
---------
As a former telescope operator of a 2.5-m telescope, I'm jealous! Congratulations and nicely done! Building my own telescope has been something I've wanted to do for quite a few years now but haven't had the time.

So tell me, why did you build one when you could have purchased one? Did you simply want the experience or wanted something specific you couldn't buy?
---------
You have a good future ahead of you if you stick to this path!
---------
This is incredible! Keep it up man, what you are doing is very impressive.
---------
Hey op, have you played around with black 3.0 for internal reflection removal? I've heard that reason bandied about as use cases for black3 and vantablack, but haven't heard any reviews from telescope makers
---------
You’re killing it kid. Keep being you and doing what you love.
---------
I wish I had your determination and talent. Keep it up!
---------
How did you get the prime mirror for your scope? Was it off-the-shelf?
---------
William Herschel didn't make his own telescope until he was 36 years old! Kudos!
---------
I can't really identify anything on your shelf or in that pile... I'm going to go ahead and assume your smarter than me. Good job kid
---------
With all the light pollution, do you need to bring that thing out of town to use it effectively?
---------
Wow awesome! Where do you source the parts from?
---------
Jeez, and here I am proud of my peanut butter sandwich.

Great job dude, not everybody gets to brag about something like this.  Really cool stuff.
---------
That is so awesome !

Proud of you !

Wish that I had co-workers that could apply deeper thought into their on-the-job responsibilities.
---------
Mad props! My dad used to make telescopes from scratch, including shaping the lenses and mirror. I miss going to star parties with them.
---------
Stupid question but do you put something around the open middle part or are you not worried about light pollution during usage? I had a friend make one like this but it was very bulky and hard to move around as the frame was mostly a giant wooden box.
---------
What kind of music do you enjoy? Curious to see what music is preferred by someone with your skill set/accomplishments as well as your drive. I know that has nothing to do with anything but like I said, I'm curious.
---------
OK kid, this old science boomer is giving you TWO BIG THUMBS UP!
---------
Have you ever read the book "The Dobsonian Telescope"? Highly recommend.
---------
15" at f2.89? That's incredible, can't wait for some photos!
---------
That’s awesome!!! Congrats! That’s lots of hard work, dedication, and talent.
---------
It’s always crazy to me how significantly more intelligent people are than I am. Keep it up man!
---------
Man, you have the makings of a professional astronomer. I hope you like calculus!!
---------
What’s your personality like? Are you more big picture or myopic?
---------
 Very cool, man.  This is awesome!  I'm sure there is more to come. :)
---------
This is pretty inspirational bro! Makes me want to learn how to build one myself! Nice job!!
---------
That's an amazing accomplishment!! Congratulations!! I don't even know you yet I'm proud of you. You are gonna do amazing things in life. Is your focus gonna be astronomy or any of the sort?? Or are you leaning towards the engineer side?? Do you have a subreddit I can follow.. feel weird asking cuz you're only 17 but I admire your intelligence!!
---------
Do you rotate the secondary mirror to stack images with alt az mounts or do you just rotate the images in post?
---------
Hell of a job! Congrats on this project. Wishing you all the best in your future.
---------
The telescope, the fact that you built it, the Ford shirt. My dude, I wanna be your friend
---------
That's pretty awesome. About how much did you spend to finish it?
---------
this is completely bananas in the best way! amazing!
---------
This is awesome. 

I’ve always found F stops so hard to understand and your post has confused me even more. 

My 50mm prime shoots at f1.4, what would your insane telescope be the equivalent of in a camera format?
---------
Hahah I thought this was a bbq at first before reading the caption, pretty neat though, nice one!
---------
Compensating much? ;-) Seriously though very impressive!
---------
Well executed my dude. 

Post some of the images you capture if you can!
---------
Nice job.  I have never built one myself but have bought many damaged or trashed OTAs and repaired them with very good results.  Biggest was a C14 that was trashed from a school.  Took me awhile to get a new tube fabbed up but was really nice in the end.  Ended up losing it in a accident though.  I have thought about building one myself as the Obsession scope I want is a bit out of my price range now.  Anyway great job and stick with it.  I wish i had gotten into astronomy in my teens.  Currently stuck in a light polluted metro area so I have unfortunately fallen out of the hobby and sold off all of my equipment.
---------
There’s so much here to be proud of! I must admit, when I reflect on my time as a 17 year old, I cannot recall a single accomplishment that comes close to this. Matter of fact, even at 33 years, I’m struggling to relate. Bravo dude, bravo!
---------
That's an excellent piece of work and very professional-looking.

If you made the mirror I assume you used a machine rather than hand-grinding a disc that size.  Heard of those, but never seen them.  I do see the name of the telescope site here, though, and will have a look.

In any event, I'll bet you have fun with it.  Good.
---------
Nerd! Nice job though. I really want a big scope myself but can't afford one. Cool to see you built your own!
---------
Sir, the world needs people like you. Keep up the good work!
---------
Wow this got to top fast, and it’s well deserving it’s position.
---------
I have a baby boy, how can I raise him to grow up to be like you? Lol, but actually I really want to know... or were you just born a genius?
---------
This is what you get done when u put your mind into it !!
---------
Woah, 14.7" at f/2.89? How are the optics? It's always hard to get good quality for such a fast design. Looks great!
---------
You are everything i aspired to be as a young kid but never had the ability to. Be proud of yourself and I truly hope other kids feel inspired by this! I also want to add that i don't want to emphasise on "kid" as this is extremely impressive no matter background or age.
---------
Kudos! Under a dark sky, M42 must be jaw dropping in that.
---------
The only way this gets better is if you worked part time and paid for all the parts yourself. 
Still bloody incredible regardless.
---------
This is really awesome good for you man dont ever stop following your dreams you're a path people much older than you wish they were able to find at that age. Good Luck
---------
Do I see  knowledge and experience of 50+ y/o scientists in a body and mind of a 17year old? Amazing!

I totally see you being top scientist and helper of the world in very close future!
---------
How much did the 14.7” primary cost??  I made my own a while back using just a 6.4” because i found one that wasn’t that expensive, but much bigger than that it seemed prices rose pretty high pretty fast
---------
Keep after it young man. You abilities and hard working nature will serve you well. 

I don't care how old you are. Life starts when it starts and you are well on your way.
---------
How many K-Nex did it take? Oh shit, that thing's real.
---------
Congratulations! What a badass accomplishment & a killer conversation starter for the rest of your life 🖤🖤
---------
Amazing, you are an exceptional human keep doing what you love!
---------
Imagine being invested in something so much and wanting something so much. Wow. I envy you, OP. Great job.
---------
You're an absolutely insane kid dude, I love it!!
---------
Don’t let anyone tell you that you are going to amount to nothing, or pull you down. You’re gonna achieve amazing things.
---------
I used to have that shirt and those same exact socks. Are you my little brother?
---------
Well done young man!    That’s really excellent.
---------
I live in your state, also do astro. I've been volunteering at the frosty drew observatory which is just over the border into Rhode Island.
---------
I had an astronomy prof at university who got his start building his own telescope! You've got a bright future!
---------
THIS IS SO COOOL!!! WHAT THE HECK DUDE!!! I don’t remember the last time I felt this proud/happy for a stranger!!! Congratulations!!!
---------
I’ve always wanted to get a telescope. It’s something I’m looking into.
---------
You may already know about Stellafane,  but if not, please check it out! I dont know if it will happen this year with Coronavirus, but it's a great place to gather with other telescope makers!
---------
How did you make the lens? I hear that is the hardest part. Good work it looks great.
---------
An im here felling awesome that i can make a flappy bird game. Keep it up dude!!
---------
Congratulations, dude! I hope you'll use your gift
---------
Let me just leave a quote here for you kid. "He who builds a bigger telescope than anyone, see further than anyone."
---------
Keep it up my man!! We will need many many more like you in the future! You give us all hope :)
---------
Nice job, kid. Thanks for the uplifting news in this uncertain time!
---------
That’s pretty rad. I want to make one with my son when he’s older.
---------
Is there a build video, plans, or a kit to purchase?
---------
I need to look up the difference between Dobson and Newtonian telescopes...
---------
Dude I used to be into space heavy as a kid, but I got out of it. I’m only 23 so not that far off from you but all I have to say is this is phenomenal work. As much as you’ve accomplished already, the future is looking great. I hope all that you’ve done leads to your aspirations coming true.

This is definitely one of the best photos I have seen of the moon. Well done !
---------
I know it's a silly comment, but you really get the sense of depth in this picture. It's so crisp and with the earthshine you really perceive a sphere and not just a circle. Beautiful work!
---------
**Zoom in**

&#x200B;

This image was created using a combination of shots from 2 different cameras, one to capture earthshine and stars, and one to capture the detail on the lit side of the moon. The shots were then stacked and pieced together for editing. I took so many shots to average out the blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence, as well as to eliminate noise captured by the camera sensor. A note to astrophotography purists: I did take some creative liberties with the composition to make up for areas with bad or incomplete data, so I would define this image as more of a composite than a true photograph. [For more of this kind of thing- come find me on instagram @cosmic\_background.](https://www.instagram.com/cosmic_background/) Feel free to DM me if you ever want to chat about astronomy/astrophotography or anything else. All my shots are taken from my backyard in Sacramento, California.

&#x200B;

Feel free to swipe this as a wallpaper. Because of the high resolution and square image, it can be cropped to fit any device and still look good, but unfortunately reddit required me to downscale the jpg quality to get it under 20MB to post, so this still isn't it's highest quality.

&#x200B;

If this looks familiar- I posted an earlier iteration of the image to r/spaceporn and r/pics on Wednesday. I have since completely reprocessed the image to eliminate the background noise I atttempted to pass off as stars (it looked fine up close- but it still bugged me because you could tell it was a noise pattern).

&#x200B;

Edit- Holy heck you guys thanks for all the compliments and the silver, gold, and platinum! Doing my best to stay on top of your questions- but here's a few things I can elaborate on based on what you guys are asking:

&#x200B;

My Equipment:

&#x200B;

The moon was captured in "tiles", so I'd point the camera at it and take a bunch of pictures of just one portion of it, and then reposition, and do it again.Just the lit side of the moon is 25 "tiles", each tile the best 50% of 2000 images stacked.  I'd stack each tile separately to average out the noise from the sensor, sharpen it to get rid of the blurring caused by the atmosphere, and then combined them in photoshop to create the final image.

---------
This is just the best picture of the moon I've ever seen
---------
This is incredible, great work! Can someone out there explain to me what created the areas that are relatively smooth in comparison with the rest of the surface? 
---------
It took me a while, but I actually approximated the actual landing site of Apollo 11!

Here's the original photo with landing area circled:

Here's a closeup showing the landing area:

---------
That's just amazing... it just hit me that I've never seen a photo of the moon quite like this, and you did it from Earth!

How long did it take to take all those photos?

And I don't suppose you could share a handful of the 50,000 shots, I'm really curious what you were working with to put this together!
---------
My toddler is obsessed with the moon. I showed her this picture, and she dropped her plate and tooted in shock. 
---------
Beautiful picture! I look forward to seeing the high-res version!

I've rescaled the background for 1080p monitors since setting it as the picture provided below was not aligned.

This is why reddit, for all it’s bs and trolls, is awesome.
---------
Oh my god, this looks amazing! Take my ghetto gold 🔶
---------
You didn't even get the dark half of the moon? Amateur.

(I kid. This is amazing. Thank you for doing it.)
---------
If I captured this image, I'd be beaming with happiness and pride. I hope you are! 
---------
You caught something with antennae...

No idea how to post a pic in comments though 

Edit: https://imgur.com/a/Nl64Hyq
---------
The poor moon. It took all those hits for us, and we cant even be bothered to go and visit it anymore. Where is that space force we were promised? 
---------
Nice attempt, but you fucked up on the lighting. Only half of it’s lit!
---------
You should go to the moon and do the same thing for Earth.
---------
This is perhaps the best picture I have ever seen. Amazing job!
---------
Don't see a link for the uncompressed. But seems clicking on it wants to load it but taking forever. 
---------
That is awesome!!! Nice job! Feel free to share it on my page at www.facebook.com/BackyardAstronomyGuy to get some more reach if you’d like.

This is some great work. Excellent composition.
---------
This should be the official picture for the moon. I feel like I am there.
---------
I can definitely seen the moons face on the top and it’s screaming. 

Outstanding image. I aspire to this type of photography 
---------
This is bloody incredible. I have never seen anything like this before.
---------
This one will be used as a reference for a while.

This fantastic picture is making me consider removing my daughter as my phone background.

This made me go outside to take another look myself. Never been particularly fussed about photography, but I'd say that's a pretty special reaction. Thanks OP
---------
This is one of the most incredible images I've ever seen. Thank you so much for sharing ❤️ I appreciate you offering us to enjoy as wallpaper, and I will totally take you up on that! 

Is there a way I can purchase a print from you? 
---------
Take all the karma on earth. And on the moon.  Very well done. Could you please explain the process? What camera, lens, gigs pixel device. etc..  thanks again. 
---------
Is the high res one 18mb? I went to the link and google only downloads a file that size
---------
This is hands down the best photo of the moon I’ve ever seen. You’re extremely talented at what you do, would love to see more! 
---------
Damn thats the best photo ive ever seen of the moon. When i zoomed in, i suddenly smiled and got happy to be alive to see it. Thanks OP
---------
How do you physically complete the daunting task of taking 50,000 photos.
---------
Just to let you know some random guy on the internet has your amazing pic as his background on his phone. 
---------
You can see exactly where they faked the moon landing! 
---------
Please create a new link to the 291MB version of the image, google photos says too many people have previewed/downloaded it so there is no longer access to it.
---------
At this level of detail it almost doesn't look real! INCREDIBLE WORK! thank you for sharing ;)
---------
My new wallpaper! This is absolutely insane. Amazing.
---------
That is awesome I'm the true sense of the word. The detail when zooming in is astonishing. Very well done, thank you for sharing 🌠
---------
This is badass. But I have a legitimate question because I really don't know. Can you see the American flag they out on the moon from a photo like this? Given the right conditions of course. 
---------
Fantastic photo. Unfortunately, all the uncompressed links appear to have been hugged to death.

Would anyone who got a copy be willing to start a torrent? 

Seems like a great use for torrents.

How come that guy takes better pictures than NASA? It’s the most beautiful picture of the moon I have ever seen!

“That’s no moon, ...... ..... it’s a space station”
---------
It's crazy how detailed this is! You can even tell it's an oblate spheroid!
---------
Wow I set this as my lock screen wallpaper on perspective mode and when it loads up it looks amazing.

Great picture and thank you
---------
how much storage space did you use for all those images? i’ve heard of people using a few terabytes for an hour of 4k video
---------
Im still having trouble seeing the alien moon bases and that glass tower they have been talking about since the 70’s.
---------
/u/ajamesmccarthy, could you rehost the same file on google drive one more time? This composition is awesome and google probably won't open up the download option again for another 24 hours.

not that you have any control over it... but this is going to be my new background image"s" :D

It’s amazing how gravity can keep both the Earth and the Moon together at such a distance.  There’s more to gravity than we know (at least today). 
---------
Wow this is so amazing! I've had to study the moon and other astronomical objects for my course so to be able to see the moon like this is genuinely moving. Keep up this amazing work!

This is one repost I'd be ok with seeing everyday for the rest of my life. Incredible work dude. Seriously incredible.
---------
This is absolutely stunning. Thank you for doing this!
---------
this is like putting on a new pair of glasses, but its my eyeballs
---------
I wouldn't have known this was an actual picture if you hadn't said anything. Amazing shot!
---------
Truly stunning and absolutely amazing! Do you mind if I make this a wallpaper?
---------
I always thought photos of the moon were rather boring - it's been done. Millions of times. I stand corrected. This is fantastic. I can't imagine the amount of time this would have taken.
---------
Welp. After 3 years I now have a new background. Thanks for this OP, it’s stellar!
---------
Wow, that’s absolutely phenomenal. Thank you for the work and sharing it.
---------
Amazing. I don't even have words to describe it. I've always loved the moon, and this is just the perfect gift someone could give to me. Thank you so much!
---------
What cameras did you use, and any speciality equipment?
---------
I've never seen the moon lit from the top before
---------
I don’t know how you keep doing it, but please never stop taking such amazing photos and giving us such a unique view of something we perhaps take for granted for the fact that it’s always there. I love this!
---------
That is hands down the best photo of the moon I have ever seen!!!! Massive well done
---------
I just wowed. Like I never wow at photos. It’s the internet it’s full of them but this daaaaaaammmmnn. 
---------
Wow. This is like HD porn where you can see the girl's pores. 
---------
This is humblingly beautiful. You gave us something our own eyes never could. Thank you.
---------
I’m over the moon with this picture. It’s absolutely stellar..... 
---------
Wow... It's wonderful! I'm speechless!

Congratulations! I'm 42 and this is the most beautiful picture of the moon that I've ever seen! 
---------
This is incredible! Thank you so much for sharing this with everyone!
---------
Not to detract from your effort to capture the moon - it is great and all, but has anyone else noticed that triangular craft in the distance?
---------
Did you have to correct for the rotation of earth?
---------
Can someone photoshop the Majora’s Mask moon into this? 
---------
Is the surrounding glow due to the moon's atmosphere, minimal that it is?
---------
With your permission, I'd like to make this into a poster for myself (not to sell or share).
---------
what program did you use to create this stack?! its damn impressive
---------
Full screen, zoom just crashed my reddit app.. D:
Mesmerizing photo!..
---------
This is just amazingly done, holy shit.  I can barely even wrap my brain around your workflow since I just play around on an extremely old copy of registax and stack 30 second video clips.  May I ask what stacking apps you used for this image?  I gotta get back out there on my telescope, gawd damn.
---------
Absolutely stunning!  Amazing work OP.  The moon looks like it’s suspended there - a perspective I’ve never seen before.  This has to be the single greatest photo of the moon I’ve ever seen.
---------
You cannot get enough upvotes for this. Absolutely stunning.
---------
This has got to be the best photo of Yue, Sokka would be impressed
---------
Serious question. I shoot photos. How the hell do you deal with/even take 50k photos? 
---------
I can’t find the uncompressed image link in the comment sea!!!
---------
I took the liberty of editing this and posting it on /r/Amoledbackgrounds, hope you don't mind. Awesome image.

---------
Thank you. New phone background. Much better than default Apple crap
---------
I fucking love the moon. Just look at it, just hanging out, reminding us we are in space. 
---------
You’re giving a high res version away for free?  Thank you.  Also, hope you kept the best for yourself, cause that’s probably the coolest shot(s) of the moon I’ve ever seen, and you better be licensing that kinda talent
---------
and chance we can get the 291MB version added somewhere for DL?
---------
Thanks for the new phone wallpaper. Sweet pic. 
---------
The link died again. Anyone have a link?
---------
This might be a dumb question but I don’t understand. Did you take 50,000 images and somehow combine them to make this photo? How did you “make” the 81 megapixel image? It’s really awesome btw!
---------
See this is why we need to take photographers like this guy on future space missions. 

NASA takes a crap ton of pictures that the public never cares about or doesn’t believe cause they are not so well represented like in this picture.
---------
I just set this as my new wallpaper on my phone. Thanks!
---------
That is such a cool picture. Zooming in and seeing all the craters is awesome!!!
---------
Hey would you be able to do the same thing but with Saturn or Mars?  I'd buy a print for sure if they look as good as this.
---------
Thank you for my phones new background. This is amazing. 
---------
[deleted]
---------
Is this the greatest photo of the moon in all of history??
---------
I know this might be a strange question but what is the scale? Like I know those craters are big,but like how many football fields is the center-leftish  crater?
---------
Your photo looks so real that it looks fake. Well done!!!
---------
What’s that purple streak/cluster at about 2 o’clock next to the edge?
---------
Congratulations, you just took one of the greatest pictures of the moon in human history.
---------
Somehow this image really reveals how the moon just hangs there. How it just floats in space, bound by nothing else but our planet's orbit. Amazing, absolutely amazing picture of the moon.
---------

Ever since I discovered it, I have always had a screenshot from r/ImaginaryStarscapes as the wallpaper for my phone because the magical and sometimes outlandish pictures there always seemed to be more beautiful than even the most awe-inspiring pictures of our actual universe.

This, though? This shit right here? 

Perfection.

Instantly my new wallpaper, possibly forever. 

Thank you.
---------
I am taking 35-40 minutes to download the 290MB file. Yes my internet sucks that much, but damn will it be cool to look at.

Edit: I was right. Cool as fuck. Worth it.
---------
This makes me wonder what our earth would look like from the moon using the same method to take the photo. Astonishing, by the way.
---------
Congrats, you ve just made my new wallpaper. Really impressive!
---------
I know this will get lost, and there’s already so many amazing comments but this is stunningly beautiful. 
---------
Can someone ELI5 how 50,000 pics makes one really nice pic?
---------
It’s fucking spectacular you can see the crevices.
---------
This is probably the best photo of the moon I’ve ever seen.  Absolutely stunning and captures all its beauty.  Bravo.
---------
I would love to print this on a large photograph. Where could I get a hi-res of the original please?
---------
My new iPhone XS plus wallpaper. Thank you very much 😊
---------
So I’m just going to go out on a limb and assume the moon was still moving while these 50,000 images were taken, lol. 

Why are the stars like this and not a series of dotted lines? Does the program choose one photo and paste the composite moon over it, or line the stars up between many photos?
---------
This may be one of the greatest pictures ever taken
---------
I wish i knew how to give silver, gold, platinum because that picture is just beautiful. Well done OP!
---------
You just made my new screen saver ...AMAZING WORK 

---------
This is absolutely incredible, thank you so much for sharing with us. Living in London with a huge level of light pollution I can't even see stars in the evening :(
---------
Roses are red, violets are blue, I spotted the footstep, can you too? 
---------
This is the most beautiful picture of the Moon I have ever seen...
---------
I want to let you know that I liked this picture so much I made it my wallpaper on my phone. I hope that is ok. 
---------
wow this looks so good it looks like it was from a game! (until you zoom up and see all the amazing detail!)
---------
That is without a doubt one of the best moon photos I’ve seen.

Great job!
---------
Pffft, you guys believe in the moon? That's just a very big spotlight! You guys are such nut jobs...

Source: [https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/6453/valles-marineris-hemisphere-enhanced/](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/6453/valles-marineris-hemisphere-enhanced/)

>Mosaic of the Valles Marineris hemisphere of Mars projected into point  perspective, a view similar to that which one would see from a  spacecraft. The distance is 2500 kilometers from the surface of the  planet, with the scale being .6km/pixel. The mosaic is composed of 102  Viking Orbiter images of Mars. The center of the scene (lat -8, long 78)  shows the entire Valles Marineris canyon system, over 2000 kilometers  long and up to 8 kilometers deep, extending form Noctis Labyrinthus, the  arcuate system of graben to the west, to the chaotic terrain to the  east. Many huge ancient river channels begin from the chaotic terrain  from north-central canyons and run north. The three Tharsis volcanoes  (dark red spots), each about 25 kilometers high, are visible to the  west. South of Valles Marineris is very ancient terrain covered by many  impact craters.
---------
Dang if you zoom in, you can see the individual craters, awesome picture
---------
Those 2...3? Impact craters on the left are they fresh? Is that why they're a darker brown color?

Edit: They're volcano's. Thank you.
---------
It reminds me a picture of earth without water. Mars looks like our home.

Earth without oceans: https://imgur.com/zeumHdt

Based on this, we need an image of what Mars would look like with oceans and flora. 

And based on that, I bet we could create a general map of where the cities would have sprung up if they mirrored our development.

That's beautiful! How many images is this a composite of?

Also, sort of looks like a very tired "me gusta" Rage comic face.. as if it retired in 2012..

It’s amazing how quickly we are advancing. Just think how far we’ll go in 20 years.

save this image so we can compare it after 100 years.

yeah we can terraform that no problem!

I find it super fascinating that I almost scrolled past this image. It took me a second to realise that it's *incredible* that we have so clear images of *another* planet. People wouldn't believe it just mere 50 years ago, and yet imagine 500 years ago at Copernicus' age. 

But to me, for a second, it was "just another photo of Mars".

I beg to differ . There is a whole documentary about an astronaut being stranded on mars in hd quality

**Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let’s get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta’aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He’s well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.**
---------
Gonna have to put an nsfw tag on it after Elon Musk finds this
---------
I can’t wait until images of all of the other planets are this clear
---------
What few are talking about is that this picture has seriously significant impacts on the future of colonization. Because whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.

What’s those 3 large dark brown spots on mars’ left side
---------
I’m not satisfied until we have an image as clear as google maps with street view included, so martians are freaked out when they see someone is taking pictures of their driveway.

this looks gorgeous on my 2k HD phone, gonna make it my wallpaper
---------
That honestly looks amazing. Space is beautiful, no?
---------
If you squint hard enough, you can see the last warmind
---------
It’s weird to think that Earth is probably just as marked up by meteorites but we don’t see the impacts in photos from space, with all the water and life and so on.
---------
Anyone else KINDA able to see something like Jabba the Hutt.
---------
If you zoom in to upper right corner you can just about see Matt Damon
---------
I immediately had to create a wallpaper out of this. [Here it is](https://imgur.com/gallery/pNRPoUk) if anyone else wants it.  
  
EDIT: Desktop wallpaper to clarify
---------
I remember a while back when one of the first photos were taken on the surface and sent to Earth. Everybody was surprised because it was so flat and barren and for some reason everyone was saying it sort of looked like Kansas. I wasn't expecting it, it was hard for me to picture the surface that way when you look at it from above, like this.
---------
for some reason my brain always registers those images as renders. i have to remind myself that this is not a 3D model but a composite of actual photographs of *another planet*. Surreal
---------
Why are the canyons on mars so different looking from canyons on earth?
---------
Almost seeing the tiny houses owned by Area51 ailens.
---------
We get pictures of Mars, and first thing we do is roast it.
---------
Any clue what the clearest image of mars is from photo technology on the earth? I figure it might be a pleasingly striking comparison.

This looks delicious. I have a problem with food.

Asteroids crates hold special minerals and bacteria. Let's go get " Calvin "
---------
Just putting this out there for those interested in great hard sci-fi about Mars: Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy, *Red Mars, Green Mars,* and *Blue Mars.* Dynamite stuff, which envisions an eventual total terraforming of Mars into an ocean planet.
---------
Is it me or does that look like a big battle scar across it?
---------
The two craters on the left side of the image, are those recent impacts (galacticly speaking)?
---------
It's weird to think our ancestors will be able to see Olympus Mons with their own eyes.

I wonder who the first person to summit THAT motherfucker will be.
---------
You should all read Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy
---------
What caused such a massive gash in the planet?
---------
The valles marineris is the coolest shit ever, grand canyon looks like a tiny crack in comparison.
---------
The (what I think are) craters on the left, odd that they're in an almost perfect line
---------
That’s a graze wound, possibly from the claws of an intergalactic phoenix.
---------
dosen't look clearer than the last time this was posted.
---------
Can’t wait for the unrelenting reposts “taken from my backyard with my iPhone 11.
---------
So what caused that huge ravine? Or what is the pervading theory?
---------
You can clearly see where a large UFO crashed into it
---------
Dang thats so clear i bet we could see Mark Watney
---------
Someday, someone will see this beauty with their eyes. How magnificent
---------
I just see a big ol’ face

---------
Wow it looks like so much fun guys let's all ditch our lame planet right now.

Am I the only one seeing a ghost screaming face on the right side?
---------
It needs to taste some of our greenhouse gasses.

I don’t get why earth only has a dozen craters visible from space but every other terrestrial object in space has thousands.
---------
Can someone pinpoint where curiousity rover is now currently in this image?
---------
wow that’s the clearest image of mars ever taken.
---------
Why does Mars look like it’s making the 😑 face?
---------
The fuck? Why doesn’t dust or birds or asteroids or glare or SOMETHING make this picture blurry? This is incredible
---------
Why don't they aim that MUTHERFUKER at the moon and see if there is a go cart and shit to show if people were really there.
---------
Then what about the clearest image of Earth ever taken?
---------
Now if only we could get a clear image like this of Olympus Mons.
---------
It amazes me that we get so much coverage on a 3 lens iPhone yet I hear almost nothing about the amazing engineering that it takes to produce an image like this.
---------
Am i the only one that sees a '•____•' face on mars?
---------
The previous "earth", soon to be what Earth will look like, next stepping stone, Venus...
---------
See if you can zoom in to get a good shot of the Exclusion zone because whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.

Photo quality decent I give it four and a half moons

Just.... look at that.

I would happily volunteer to go to Mars if I was ever given the chance, I don’t think I’d care if I died, as long as I had the chance to go into space and then land on Mars

ESA just published a very high res photo of Mars and it shows a very different planet. With well defined and visible polar ice caps,different colors and many more cratters. I mean... even if it's the other side, where are the fucking ice caps?

https://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2019/09/Mars_Express_view_of_Terra_Sabaea_and_Arabia_Terra
---------
One day someone will be able to point to a place in the photo and say “that’s where I live”
---------
Wow, look at those 3 perfectly aligned, and arguably same size, impact craters(volcanos?) on the left side, that's crazy
---------
Wow.  For the first time since I was a kid I just thought about a favorite planet.  If they terraform Mars and colonize it, kids will look at Mars like I looked at NYC.  Some grand place I could move to when I turn 18.  Except now we are talking other planets.  I know it’s just a picture but seeing it this clearly makes it seem so much closer in every way.

The day we colonize Saturn is going to be a shit show.
---------
Does anyone know what is speculated to have created that giant scar?
---------
Whether we wanted it or not.... we’ve taken a clear picture of the surface on Mars
---------
I want anal beads that are accurate to scale (comparatively) of the nine planets.

edit a word

Looks like it’s frowning at Earth as it knows we are destined for the same fate.

Boeing vs Elon Musk! Who will win? 

All of us actually. Our children as well. 
---------
This is the type of competitive atmosphere that must be encouraged both socially and politically. Don't forget that the last space race gave us a lot of the technology today we take for granted. 
---------
Musk won't care if Boeing beats SpaceX. The net result is that we fucking go to Mars.

EDIT: I'm ok with this being my new top comment. Fuck yes.
---------
Now THIS is a space race we can all get behind... it benefits humanity no matter who loses!

So if he wins will his hair come back like Elon's?
---------
[Amazing response to this from Bobak Ferdowsi.](https://i.imgur.com/nOG8e2v.png)  
(He's an engineer at JPL and was part of the curiosity rover team)
---------
When Elon said "Do it" all I could think of was the Emperor Palpatine meme
---------
Elon is playing the infinite game. He doesn't care about his competition and is just trying to make his businesses be the best they can be. At least thats how it seems to me..
---------
gotta be honest i think if Boeing actually wanted to they could be on mars in 4 years.
---------
You know it must be so crazy to the creator of Twitter that his creation has been the platform for so many crazy, important, and historical moments.
---------
At one time countries were competing to go to the moon, now it's companies competing to go to mars.  Makes me wonder who runs the world now? hmmm...
---------
I honestly think he's just happy to have somebody to play with.
---------
I took his "Do it" response as more of a "Do it, as long as someone does". 

I think Musk's aspirations and appreciation for his work supercede any race for the finish line.
---------
Space race is the best way to win Civilization. Ask Sid Meier.
---------
Breaking News: Boeing files several hundred patents crippling Elon Musk's rocket aspirations while Boeing begins to sell off assets from its space exploration division.

Joking of course, but unfortunately this is what most 'competition' and 'free market forces' have devolved in to.
---------
United Airlines is going to beat up and drag off the first group to Mars
---------
If this actually happens I might die happy.

First time since I was 10 that I see a glimmer of hope for the species.
---------
This is thoroughly awesome. We as a species need more of this kind of friendly but driving competition. It helps drive business in an important sector forward as well as bring us closer to getting out to other places.
---------
This is the kind of thing that put men on the moon
---------
as long as someone gets there, he'll be able to get home.
---------
Can we stop fangirling about Twitter crap and start getting excited when these companies actually do things about it?

I'm not saying they're not doing something about it (obviously they are), it's just that I don't want this PR to become a well-beaten and long deceased horse by the time we get to Mars.

Youre milking it. Don't milk it.


This private space race has been in the works for several years now. It's not really news; and Musk has always been like this with his competitors in all his businesses.
---------
Please please PLEASE let us have another space race. So much technology, So much wonder, So much excitement...
---------
And just like this we'll get a movie where Boeing CEO goes super saiyajin and literally beats Musk into the Mars. Thus Elon Musk will be first on the Moon and Boeing CEO will still have beaten him to the Moon.
---------
Okay but like I think that Elon genuinely wants to see Boeing beat him
---------
How does one pronounce Boeing? I've said Bow-ing all my life and never bothered to check if that was accurate.
---------
I feel relieved as I an studying for Aerospace Engineering. I am not only excited, but hopeful for us.
---------
Grandad, where were you when the Mars Race started? 
Well I had my dick in one hand and the other hand in a bag of Doritos.

What a time to be alive.
---------
I mean I can challenge Usain Bolt to a race, but nobody else would call what follows an actual competition. 
---------
Doubt Boeing will do it. The moment anything they're trying to achieve scares shareholders, they'll drop it for something safer and more cost effective.
---------
It's looking more and more likely that history books on this era are going to be full of tweets.
---------
When you're so rich that going to Mars is a game to you
---------
Pretty sure it’s a publicity battle, but anyway.
---------
100% guarantee that nothing will come of this. A conversation on twitter doesn't automatically mean a space race started
---------
Lol, this isn't a space race, this is a PR race. Corporations have no higher ideals than profit, it tends to lead to myopic thinking, I'll call a flash in the pan on this one. 
---------
A technology/space race that isn't fueled by hysteria and jingoism?? Sign me up!
---------
I attended the congressional hearings on this before anyone was actually allowed to compete with Boeing and NG. The argument for a free market was competition is healthy and encourages innovation. Many members argued against this. 
---------
That moment when you realize that creating competition was Musk's plan all along. 
---------
Which is better: have two companies competing so you have the competitive atmosphere and additional motivation possibly, or two companies working together sharing data and resources? It seems like together they could do it faster, better, and cheaper. Maybe not though. Maybe by combining forces it would actually be slower as more layers of management? Either way it’s an exciting time for those of us watching in amazement. 
---------
Can u make more comfortable airplanes first pls
---------
This makes me so happy to see. We're going to be space bound soon
---------
clever play from musk, boeing has to be closing in on reusable rockets or musk is just going to bankrupt them and claim another part of the worlds industry.
---------
Yeah.... Nope. I doubt there will be any race. We're talking businesses and not countries. Businesses that need to show investors profits. Unless there is some immediate commercial gains that can be realized in these endeavors, market forces will determine the speed at which these companies push to reach their goals.
---------

---------
You do realize that both of these programs are funded by the US government, right?
---------
[deleted]
---------
Why couldn’t Kim Jong Un worry more about having shit on mars. Then we’d get more government funding that way.
---------
The first space race was between two governments and its tax funded organizations. The new space race will be between two privately funded corporations with the backing of some government institutions. 
---------
lol please there's no race.  If the SLS gets off the ground before SpaceX has gotten to mars I would be very surprised, and I say this more out of skepticism for Boeing then out of fanboi love for SpaceX
---------
Finally a practical use for Twitter, getting a  private space race competition.  
---------
Erhm...I know competition is cool and everything but imagine the world where Boeing and Musk collaborate. In that world we are probably trying to figure out how to get out of the solar system
---------
Super intense like real intense like my butt is clenching from excitement intense.
---------
I like his reply . It shows that he doesn't really care whose first. He wanted people to get encouraged  and try to achieve such a feat . It's a smart trick really to encourage action .
---------
Wait please stop this evil capitalism... only over budget government programs can possibly go to mars. 
---------
How long until I can be a proud asteroid miner, get screwed over by Earth and Martian oppression, and remember the Canterbury?
---------
This is how I see it play out: 
* Elon will push the rocket like he usually does. boeing will be about as fast as he is.

* In Elons demtermination he will start his rocket up early. It'll blow up. In the explosion he will be injured. The investors flee from the "sinking ship". Elon withdraws from the public.

* A year later when Boeing is about to start it's rocket. Elon suddenly appears at the scene with a badass skar across his eye and a prostetic cyborg arm. He captures the space-ship and becomes a rogue space pirate! 

\*outer space silent arrrrrrr*
---------
I was going to cheer on capitalism but then realized that I'm looking at Boeing.
Go get em, Elon.
---------
I'm more afraid of the corporate space race than the one done by governments.
---------
This is great and wonderful and I love the modern resurgence of space desires.

But I do not like that it is in the hands of private businesses. They must find a way to monetize. Even if it's just from the patents they develop from developing the technology, they still have certain pressures to do profitable space exploration, not necessarily scientific ones.
---------
A marketer was born. Mars is a dead planet. It was a lot cooler before we knew that space was dead.
---------
Man, what an exciting time! Can’t wait for the 2020s and 30s!
---------
Elon Musk honestly wants them to win if they can do it faster than he can, and I love him for that.
---------
Hey, I don’t care who gets me to a future moon base or a mars mission- just get me up there and (if at all possible) get me home

I still can't believe we have a picture of space-time being heavily distorded.
---------
The actual image looks waaaay better than I thought. Obviously rather blurry, but it matches pretty well with the best case simulations of what the image should look like.
---------
Really cool achievement, I have no clue what I expected out of this picture but the idea still baffles me.
---------
This is so fucking awesome. But this one is from M87 right?  

I thought they were also going to show one of Sagittarius A*
---------
40 billion kms wide and 500 million trillion kms away.
This is too much for my tiny human brain to comprehend
---------
I'm honestly just happy that so many people are interested in seeing this that the ESO website is getting hugged to death. What a great day for science.

EDIT: They just finished the conference with a Stephen Hawking quote and now I'm sad that he wasn't able to be here to see this amazing discovery.
---------
"Black holes dont exist. You are crazy to think they do."

&#x200B;

"Black holes hypothetically might exist, but highly doubtful."

&#x200B;

"Black holes are mathematically proven, but no direct observed evidence"

&#x200B;

"Black holes have direct, observed, and corroborated evidence".

&#x200B;

All in one lifetime. While most people wont see a real-world impact in their daily lives from this just yet, the enormity of this scientific breakthrough will change humanity slowly but surely. Hopefully for the better.
---------
RIP Stephen Hawking. He would have been absolutely elated to see this.
---------
[deleted]
---------
I can't believe I'm actually seeing this in my lifetime.

If you want to understand what you're looking at I recommend this video: https://youtu.be/zUyH3XhpLTo
---------
This is Messier 87’s black hole. Very impressed by the quality.

I’m a bit puzzled though, I was sure we would be getting Sgr*.
---------
I know that this was what I was expecting to see but I’m still amazed by the photo
---------
For those curious as to what this actually is:

>The image shows a bright ring formed as light bends in the intense gravity around a black hole that is 6.5 billion times more massive than the Sun
---------
Radio astronomer here!  This is *huge* news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it's one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, [see stars orbit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/bb6gj8/trajectories_of_stars_orbiting_the_supermassive/), etc) and another to *actually get a friggin' image of one*.  Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!

Now what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can't escape there, but related to a special area called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), which is basically the "point of no return" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is *not* actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn't actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can't escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in.  In the case of the M87 black hole, it's estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own [Sag A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*).

Now, on a more fundamental level than "it's cool to have a picture of a black hole," there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on.  First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR.  Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a [gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity.  We don't think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don't understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how [relativistic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn't understand, and that we can't test in a lab on Earth because it's so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions.  Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have *direct imaging* of an event horizon?  It's priceless!

Third, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly *hard* and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done.  I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and [have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/8tfhgr/guess_whos_observing_tonight_at_the_submillimeter/) (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement.   Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- *that* is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon.  To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one's data (after it's shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet's too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data.  This is so incredibly difficult I'm frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I'm not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)

A final note on that- why M87?  Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy?  Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it's limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve.  Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it's relatively nearby at "only" 25,000 light years away.  M87's black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 *times* bigger than our own galaxy's supermassive black hole.  This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it's ~54 million light years).  The reason it's cool though is it's such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there's going to now be a ton of information in how those work!

Anyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation!  It's amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!

TL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do.  Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.

Edit: if you really want to get into the details, [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205) is the journal released today by *Astrophysical Letters* with all the papers!  And it appears to be open access!

Edit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn't also revealed today.  Per someone I know really involved in one of the telescopes, the weather was not as good at all the telescopes as it was for the M87 observation (even small amounts of water vapor in the air absorb some of the signal at these frequencies), and the foregrounds are much more complicated for Sag A* that you need to subtract.  It's not yet clear to me whether data from that run will still be usable, or they will need to retake it.
---------
It's mind boggling to think that taking a picture of something that's 500 million trillion kms away is even possible.
---------
Welp Veritasium was exactly right.

What an exciting time to be alive.
---------
Fucking unbelievable, In 100 of years in physics books is gonna be written:"In April 10th, the first photo of a black hole was released", it happened in my lifetime.
---------
I honestly don't think that's too dissimilar to what Interstellar created. Neat!

Look ! A **SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE**

*Oooooooooh, you set my soul alight*
---------
The idea of black holes has always been fascinating to me, but to actually see one, truly, is mind boggling. Space is awesome. 
Edit: I also see people saying they're disappointed. Don't be. This is amazing, and the fact that we get to see this is a gift to science and humans' understanding of space.
---------
It's really cool that we all actually got to see this within our lifetimes.
---------
It sucks that Stephen Hawking didn't get to see this
---------
All of these scientists are so freaking excited and so am I. This is truly an amazing achievement!
---------
Incredible image, so hard to really grasp the sheer extremes of physics being captured in this shot of M87's galactic core.

There are two vague extensions on either side of the accretion disc, are those polar jets of some sort?
---------

---------
They fucking did it. And to think scientists were so spot on with their simulations and projections of how a black hole would look like, gives the scientists confidence I'm sure.

Makes me wonder what more they can learn with these images and what more interesting breakthroughs like this that my generation will witness.
---------
Looks like a sun with a big black hole in the middle. Soundgarden knew.
---------
Can that ring be different colours? Or does it stay orange. Sorry If it’s a dumb question
---------
Each telescope produced 350 **terabytes of data** ***PER DAY***.  Jesus, this was a huge project. Congratulations to all the scientists involved!
---------
Still so weird to see... We don't even know what is happening 'inside'
---------

---------
Looks about as terrifying as what you would expect from a black hole. 

That photo is making history, well done to everyone involved
---------
This is how it looked like 52 million years ago.
---------
300 million times the size of earth. Can you even imagine....
---------
that is the neatest thing I think I will ever see.
---------
I remember giving a class speech on Black Holes when I was in 8th grade.

All the giggling that went around the class at the mention of the term.

But as soon as I began to describe what it actually was, the entire class became fascinated at it.

Now 20 years after I had given that speech, I'm seeing this entity for the first time.

The feels.
---------
Astounding.  We can now see an image of a black hole, in another galaxy billions of billions of kilometers away, to what appears to be a similar resolution to what Galileo would have seen the moons of Jupiter when he looked through his telescope a few hundred years ago
---------
Ready to see this in every single pic related subreddit today
---------
I'd like to compare this black hole [picture](https://cdn.eso.org/images/newsfeature/eso1907a.jpg) with our pictures of [Pluto](https://cdn.fstoppers.com/styles/full/s3/media/2015/09/nasa-pluto-older-photograph-pixelated.jpg) before New Horizons did its flyby.  Pluto is 738 miles in diameter, roughly 7.5 ~~million~~ billion kilometers from earth, and has an angular size of 0.06″ – 0.11″.

This black hole's shadow is roughly 100 billion kilometers across.  That's massive, over 135 million times the diameter of Pluto.  But it is 55 million light-years away.  That is 5.20e20 kilometers away.  For comparison, for every kilometer of distance between Pluto and Earth, there are 69.4 billion kilometers between Earth and Messier 87's supermassive black hole.  The angular size would be just 0.0000397".

We struggled to get a grainy image of Pluto, but the combined efforts of our radio labs let us get a relatively clear picture of something that appears to be about 300 times smaller in our night sky.  If you tried to drop the black hole picture into the old Pluto picture while keeping the relative size accurate to what they'd be from Earth, the black hole picture wouldn't fill up 10% of a single pixel.  It is a massive feat of resolution.
---------
So in other words, we've just objectively proven a lot of theoretical physics, haven't we? 

Fuckin' love science, man.
---------
Does this mean we can, in the future, get an even better picture?
---------
I'm at one of the key institutions with part of the team and it is just amazing to see this and know all the work that has gone into capturing this image
---------
Shouldn’t you see only a circle of light? Because a black hole is a sphere?
---------
Honestly creepy as hell.  Like an evil eye looking back at us
---------
I looked at it thrice so that I could look at it for Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein too
---------
"Do not go gentle into that good night, rage, rage against the dying of the light"
---------
This is incredible! But I thought it was going to be an image of Sag A* but this is from M87. Did I miss something?
---------
I so wish Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking we’re alive to see this.   All my life the science of black holes has gone from very uncertain... to this!   To turning the Earth into a telescope to pull the real data into a real image of a REAL BLACK HOLE.   

A real black hole!  A real singularity inside of it!  The physicists must be going nuts.
---------
Such a shame that Professor Stephen Hawking didn't get to see this day!
---------
[deleted]
---------
Can't wait to see the people who are going to whine because their expectations were too high
---------
To be honest i'm very satysfied with this image. Everybody, including me, was like "Don't get your hopes up, it will just be some pixels". Of course it isn't exactly HD, but the fact that we can actually clearly see it is fantastic.
---------
As a kid I wanted to get into astrophysics and I'd tear into every book I would find. Mars and black holes were my obsession. Whenever I'd read about black holes, I always felt like the authors despair about not knowing how it looks like was very evident. In every book I read too.

And now I'm staring at a picture of a black hole, it makes me giddy. I'm sure those authors feel the same too.
---------
It took this long to get a picture of something that sucks in everything around it, including all light? If astronomers wanted a picture of my mother-in-law, they could have just asked.
---------
This is already my new phone wallpaper. Absolutely incredible. What a time to be alive. I have a ***photograph*** of a black hole as my wallpaper
---------
Now i know how the people who first discovered the planets or the Americas feel. I mean, hundreds of thousands of years from now humans (if we haven't destroyed ourselves) will be exploring our galaxy and expanding out from the solar system. Sure, we won't be around for that.

But in the entirety of human history, out of all the time we've existed and for all the time we have left, we were there to see the first ever picture of a black hole.

 Right here, right now, we were the first.

Humanity: *Captures image of black hole, a concept so unfathomable it seems like science fiction, 50 million light years away, after the invention of a simple modern telescope 400 years ago*

Reddit critics: "a bit underwhelming"

lmao
---------
Amazing thing to see. Glad I'm around for this.
---------
So now is the accretion disk oriented in relation to us?  Light gets bent so much around the hole it's hard to tell if I'm looking "straight down" at the disk or if pointing towards us and we are looking at it edge-on.
---------
I'm struggling to comprehend how big this is, both in importance of our understanding of the deep and mysterious world outside, as well as the size of this thing. 

Looking at it on a screen doesn't do to justice. 

Wow. I'm honoured and privileged to have seen this in my lifetime

Wow.
---------
We know what Pluto looks like, now we know what a black hole looks like. What a neat time.

Guys, we're living on a full-page feature of a history book right now. So many years we've been on this planet, and this is the first image any human has EVER seen of a black hole! That's hard for me to wrap my brain around.
---------
Astrophysicist working on quasars here! Just wanted to share my absolute amazement at this image and the ways this discovery will affect my work.

&#x200B;

The most incredible thing in this image is how closely our models predicted the accretion structure in such a deeply-relativistic regime. The simulations used to make these predictions relied on GRMHD - general-relativistic magneto-hydro-dynamics. This in an incredibly complex and difficult area of physics, far beyond general relativity on its own. Think of the simulations that manufacturing companies have to make using fluid dynamics for e.g. air flow around airplanes and cars. Dealing with the basic properties of a fluid such as its mass, compression, and temperature is difficult enough to require supercomputers *on its own, in constant gravity.* Now add magnetic fields and their interplay with the fluid. Then add self-attraction and variable gravity. *Then* add general relativity, with space-time, a moving and curving frame of reference which interplays with all of the above dynamically and non-linearly. It is simply astonishing that the outcome matches reality *at all.* This is by far the most extreme test of our understanding of GRMHD to date. It gives us a ton of confidence that the assumptions and simplifications that we make to even be able to run the models at all... are actually very correct.

&#x200B;

Next, there's the ability of black holes to drive jets. These jets have been observed directly in many galaxies including M87 but the physics behind their ejection is very debated. How does the direction of black hole 'feeding' relate to the largest, galaxy-scales of jets? How do they vary in time? Which part of the structure around the black hole launches the jets? With an image, a disc size, and time-variability (or lack thereof) we can suddenly build models with a lot fewer assumptions. Plus, our confidence in GRMHD is now a lot higher, and jet-launching is a deeply related to the magnetic fields around the event horizon.

&#x200B;

We have now reached the final scale in the study of quasars, after detecting inter-galactic jets, effects on the host galaxy, central velocity effects on stars, gas feeding reservoirs, and now the event horizon itself! I did not think this would happen in my lifetime. I'm jumping with excitement at all the new research which will come out of this!! 

&#x200B;

In the meantime, feel free to ask anything related to supermassive black holes / quasars.
---------
It looks like the eye of sauron. Fucking awesome.
---------
It's these scientfic achievements that makes everything else seem so insignificant. Just makes you pause for a moment in this hectic world and go 'Wow'. 

A real image of a black hole... insane just thinking about it. 
We're really honoured to see this image during our lifetime, massive props to the scientists and researchers out there putting in the hours to get us these breakthroughs.
---------
What we’re seeing there is larger than our entire solar system with the mass of 6,500,000,000 of our suns. Truly mind boggling.
---------
[deleted]
---------
So all of Einstein's/the community's predictions about the black hole were really accurate? That's pretty cool.
---------
This event made me nostalgic about my younger years when I was into cosmology, it brought my curiosity for space back. It might not look much in this photo. But it's very real, up there, and very far from us. And we got to see one now. 

Life can be really exciting!
---------
So grateful to be alive right now. This is the kind of shit that makes me proud of humanity! Thank you to all the hardworking people trying to find the bigger picture and help us understand our universe.
---------
For those asking: Elon confirmed that they did NOT successfully recover the center core. Only 1 of the intended 3 engines was able to re-light for the landing burn, and it struck the water near the droneship.

>The center one lit but the outer two did not, and that was not enough to slow the stage down. Apparently it hit the water at 300 miles per hour and took out 2 of the engines on the drone ship. That sounds like some pretty fun footage, so if the cameras didn't get blown up as well then we'll save that for the next blooper reel.

Source: [SpaceX post-launch press conference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORTP545vAc)

Overall this was still a hugely successful launch for SpaceX - congrats to all involved.

**UPDATE**: [After spending several hours parked in orbit around the Earth, the second stage successfully made its third and final burn, pushing its orbit beyond even the original stated goal of Mars and all the way out to the asteroid belt.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/961083704230674438) That means the primary mission has officially been completed.

**UPDATE 2**: [SpaceX issued some corrected orbital data - aphelion is actually 1.71 AU rather than the originally reported 2.6.](https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/961394843648954368) That puts it just past Mars orbit, not out to the asteroid belt.

Unbelievable to see this live (on YouTube). Wow. I really wish I had been there in person.

I'm new to all this stuff, but... did I just watch a giant rocket lift off, launch a car into space, and then fall back down to earth and land in the exact spot from which it lifted off?
---------
I was waiting for the reveal that it's actually Elon in the car.
---------
That landing of the boosters. HOLY SHIT!

That was impressive as hell!
---------
I laughed so hard when someone *accidentally* called it the "Fuckin heavy" about 20 seconds before launch.

That dual booster landing was sick!

* startup: successful 
* liftoff: successful
* max-q: survived 
* booster engine cutoff: successful
* main engine cutoff: successful
* fairing deploy: successful
* starman: in orbit
* boosters land: successful
* stage 2 shutdown: successful
* core lands: unsuccessful (it ~~landed, just not as planned~~ crashed)

9/10 is very impressive.

It will be perfect if the core survives, but don't make it a big deal if it failed. A lot of data to learn from either way.

5th grade science teacher in Florida here. The launch delay pushed it past dismissal. When 3:45 was approaching I went searching for some students. Found an after school coding club, brought them outside and set up the stream on my laptop. We watched the incredible live stream and looked South towards Canaveral to see the rockets in the sky.

Those boys and girls were out of their minds excited about what was going on. I was so inspired by their enthusiasm. Thank you SpaceX for reinvigorating the love of science and exploration in these young people.
---------
One of the few benefits of living on the east coast of Florida. I'm about 4 hours away and could still see that thing. It was FAST. I've seen many launches from here but this one e was gone out of sight in a minute. Crazy 
---------
Elon can now phone NASA every morning and ask, 'Dude, Where's my car?"

---------
Seeing those two booster come down together - in-mother-fucking-credible. Totally worth ignoring my co-workers for 10 minutes.

Now, what happened at the drone ship?

Absolutely surreal experience. We've witnessed history, folks.

Fifty seven years ago, I watched - live -  Alan Shepard launched to be the second man to orbit the Earth.  

Today, I sat in front of my computer, sobbing uncontrollably as Falcon Heavy lifted off successfully, inaugurating a whole NEW ERA of space exploration.  It was truly an amazing experience for me.  

My brother was one of the engineers on the F1 rocket at the space center in Huntsville, originally Redstone Arsenal.  He even worked with some of the German scientists who were spirited to the US after WWII.  

During the 70's and 80's, I worked on several satellite projects and one of the Apollo missions in various ways.  

Today, I feel that the future is here.  I am so very proud of everyone who worked on this project.  It was flawless!  And I know how difficult that is.

Those two side boosters landing same time was like the sickest thing I've ever seen...chills

I know that we have plenty of pics of the Earth from orbit by now, but for some reason this screenshot I grabbed is just blowing my mind - https://imgur.com/so6bBU5. 

Edit: another one.... https://imgur.com/a/wOx0o. I am imagining a (very) distant future in which we can simply drive off planet. I have to admit I teared up watching the launch, I can't even explain why, it's just so cool! 
---------
Did the core make it? I just saw the stream, but they didn't say for sure it survived
---------
That was amazing. Absolutely amazing. Loved the "Don't Panic" on the dash. 
---------
I still can't believe they [launched a car into space](https://i.imgur.com/9mKqLqE.jpg). That was absolutely incredible.
---------
I never got to experience the Space Shuttle launches but man I imagine this is the feeling many felt watching all those years ago. Absolutely incredible and historic. 
---------
I just watched a man use a rocket to launch a car into space for the next billion years. Then I watched the boosters perform a synchronized, undamaged landing.

We're in the future.
---------
I remember a time when we didn't have cars in orbit around the sun.
---------
This shit is going to inspire a whole new generation of future coders, flight engineers, mathematicians, astronauts and all kinds of people who look up at the sky today who might just be there *Tomorrow*.

Thank you SpaceX. [I certainly dream of it again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmQsrXLofMY)

Seriously I wasn't expecting the boosters to land simultaneously. Told my wife, "Babe if they land at the same time and don't explode, then I will."

This is the beginning of a new age!

Elon: Yes, I'd like to report that my car has gone missing. I don't believe anyone will be able to locate it on Earth.
---------
What's the story with the center core?  They said it landed.  Pics or it blew up.

Regardless, it was amazing to watch!  Those side booster landings were incredible.

EDIT: It didn't land, got it.  It was still an awesome test all around!
---------
Trying not to cry at work about a rocket successfully launching. 

This is so beautiful to watch.

I’m pretty sure Elon Musk just expertly disposed of a body.

Let's hope we avoid a repeat of 1972 with that LEM lifting off the Moon and then nothing for 45 years (although Cassini-Huygens and Curiosity brought tears of joy to be fair).
---------
I know this sentiment is shared among the rest of my friends and peers here at /r/space...  but seriously, this is history in the making, live and available for everyday people to watch.  For young space-travel enthusiasts, professionals, hobbyists...  this is a grand day.  I'm literally shaking.

This spring, I am heading back to school to study astrophysics.  I know that it's a long way down the road, but seeing SpaceX land its first booster a couple years ago inspired me to start the process of cleaning up my life, going back to school, and contributing whatever I can to this incredible and amazing field.

I love you all.  This is a joyous day!
---------
Saw [this](https://i.imgur.com/noM0glO.jpg) on their careers page after the launch. Looks like it worked! 
---------
Is losing the core a big deal? How bad is it? I don't know much about all this. Huge congratulations from Russia - what an achievement! Phenomenal.
---------
Why did Elon Musk send a Tesla Roadster into space? 

Because the resale value will Skyrocket. 
---------
amazing, any word on the core booster landing yet?

    Who would have thought the opening of Heavy Metal (1981) would pretty much become reality.

My dads a driver for SpaceX delivering 1/4 million dollar parts for the company. He has about 7 Falcon 9 patches that have flown in space. Calling him after the launch I'm sure that was the most important part of his life putting my birth to shame.... I'm not even sad, GO DAD AND SPACEX!!!!

I got mad goosebumps and frisson watching all of that, this is the new age. We've just witnessed history.

No marketing team can pull a better stunt to advertise a product. Beat that inappropriate Dodge pick up truck advert...

If you missed the launch...

Edit: 
Launch countdown at 18:53
Landing at ~26:26
---------
The Tesla Roadster, fastest car in the universe!
---------
In my opinion, SpaceX just cemented their position at the head of space flight capability. To me, they are now ahead of NASA. 
---------
Half the time they said “Falcon Heavy” I misheard it as “Fuckin Heavy” and it made it way funnier and badasser
---------
Any news on the central core? The camera were cuts during the final landing, no news on the drone so far.
---------
Watching this helped pull me out one of the worst depressions I've dealt with in a **loooong** while. Witnessing this historical event at all, let alone *live*, made me feel like my problems that are causing me so much internal conflict and pain don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. I have no idea if it will last, but I'm feeling hopeful no matter what happens. Nothing is going to take this away from me but me.
---------
I’m a teacher and live streamed it for my class and the rest of my hallway. The kids were appropriately amazed. The teachers...we were like little kids on Christmas. Amazing. We are living in the future.

---------
one of the most impressive mind blowing things i ever saw ... and it only took 4minuters to get to 10000km speed with 110km altitude orbit ... and not even 9 minutes total including landing the boosters ...mind fucking blown ..and this was achieved by a private entity ... as a test :D ..wow ... if only we did this all the time instead of developing tanks and submarines with more nukes  
---------
One day there probably be a mission on Mars that goes wrong and that Roadster will play a vital role in getting the astronaut back to earth.


*Oh wait*

Live view of starman 

https://youtu.be/aBr2kKAHN6M
---------
Part of me thinks Elon is an amazing showman and the center core landed... and there is gonna be a kickass "Surprise motherfuckers!" as it floats into the dock.
---------
Watching those 2 boosters land together literally made me shed a tear (or two.. or three) so beautiful! Fingers crossed for the core.
---------
So is the Tesla just on it's own now floating towards Mars?
---------
This was my first launch. Is it normal to get incredibly teary-eyed while everything is happening?
---------
Watched this in vr with a room full of strangers across the globe. This is the future. 
---------
Can someone do the math:

With its current speed, how long until the roadster surpasses the cumulative mileage of every car ever?
---------
The starman is such a mind blowing view I took some screen shots from the live. The res isn't really there, so they can't be desktop wallpapers, hopefully mobile one's:
[Starman in fuckin space with the fuckin earth](https://imgur.com/a/zkIWO)

---------
No one is going to complain about to the range of an electric car now.
---------
I was having dinner with some mates at the pub when we realized that Musk's big dick rocket was being broadcast on live TV. By pure chance, we looked just in time for the launch, as the countdown was starting.

Fuck me that was a beautiful sight.
---------
Watching those two boosters come down was absolutely incredible. It was equal parts beautiful and surreal. 

I cannot believe I just watched a car get launched into space. The future is so fucking cool and I am so happy I'm alive to see this. 
---------
Is there news about the center core? Did it land?
---------
Anyone confirmed Elon is still on earth and not in the boot on his way to Mars?
---------
At 38:27 I think they said "We lost the center core".
---------
Hearing “The Falcons have Landed” was such a rush. Seems like it will be looked back upon as a historic quote! 
---------
That dual landing was very science fiction - I feel like im living in the future.

I always wondered how long does it take astronauts to get over the holy shit this is amazing part of the job.
---------
These type of videos always stir that sense of wonder and awe in me.

The ISS in general is just so mind blowing.
---------
What's the landmass they're over?

Edit: It appears to be Mexico. The "island" is actually the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula.
---------
The black void behind the earth gives me goosebumps. such a beautiful planet! i mean what are the chances!
---------
It’s such a privilege even to watch this. What a beautiful world! 


Edit: Thank you kind Redditor for the platinum; I’m so stoked! Happy New Year!
---------
Mentioned it in a reply to another comment, but I love how this drives home the, "There is no sound in space" statement. 

Sure, we hear anything hitting the microphone, but it doesn't pick up how the astronaut attached the carabiniere to hull of the station with--what looked like--a good amount of force. This would have definately made some sort of sound even if the mic was covered and muffled that something would have been picked up at that distance.

It's surreal and fascinating...oh, and I suppose the view is pretty great.

Edit: Was pointed out that "argument" was a poor choice of words and rectified with "statement"

Edit 2: Wow been a long time lurker and this was my most up-voted post. Thanks for the internet points.
---------
Amazing. But what I was most shocked by is that everything they were doing seemed like it was in real time, but whenever outer-space is portrayed in movies, there seems to be a sense of slow motion. 
---------
For me the most amazing thing to imagine is always, that the earth takes up your entire field of view when you are up there. It's not like: "oh look theres a marble". No it's incomprehensible large. "You can't see from horizon to horizon without moving your head" large [better explanation](https://youtu.be/mxhxL1LzKww?t=245)
---------
Must be incredible to work on something that is moving at 17,150 miles per hour.

Someone able to recognize continent, isle down there ?

I think I can see my house!

But seriously, it's mind boggling to think that we are looking at something real. My mind assumes it CGI. Such an amazing feeling to think about how much more there is to our reality than what we can physically see and feel from the ground. 

Our home is truly beautiful.

"Spaceflight is a spiritual quest in the broadest sense, one promising a revitalization of humanity."

One day, we will look back artifacts like this or even the moon landing and realize that those events were our greatest achievements.Or so I hope. Hopefully we will look back and think to ourselves how selfish we were as nations back then. Hopefully, we will journey the stars. 
---------
Here is why I like this video.

We could be observing areas of Earth that could be experiencing monstrous winds, sirens blaring, physical fighting , and so much more. From up there, however, it really puts size and scale into perspective. 

None of those things can be seen or detected. It almost looks like nothing is happening. The illusion that time is frozen.

It’s like looking at your fingertip. You could watch it for 5 hours and see nothing of interest. Truthfully, there’s a whole medley of interesting things going on. Bacteria from an outside source can be crawling around. Biological processes could be eliminating such harmful bacteria. Neurons are detecting wind, or lack there of, brushing against it. So many biological process are occurring, and we would have no idea without microscopes.

It is up to us to decide if we are the bacteria infecting Earth, or the biological process protecting it.
---------
Dont know what I expected when I turned sound on for this
---------
I cannot fathom that the carabiner is not making noise. I mean, my mind NEEDS to hear it but it just doesn’t make a sound. 

Side note, do you think without the pull of gravity that there is still a sense of omg I’m so high?
---------
Dude as much as I want to go to space, I couldn’t imagine being out there, all that nothingness. Thousands of miles that separate you and everything you’ve ever known, that guys just chillin in the danger zone. I’d have a panic attack.
---------
Human beings do this. Like, someone woke up this morning and this was on their to-do list. My brain. I just cant.
---------
I would do anything to be able to experience this!
---------
I wonder if there’s a sense of height when you’re up there. I’m afraid of heights, looking over the edge of a building scares me. For some reason, up there, I imagine the fear would be different or non existent. What do I know though?
---------
Can you get a fear of heights in space? Or is the scale just so blown out, your brain doesn't register it as "height?"
---------
If an astronaut pushed himself of the ISS, how long would it take for him to "land"?  
Also, given that they have enough oxygen for the entire trip, could they land safely if they had a parashute Baumgartner style?  
edit: Thanks for the anwsers all! <3  
From what i gathered ~~it all depends on how good he would be at flapping his arms, like the elegant and majestic Moose~~ he would die of food/water shortage long before turning into a fireball.
---------
ELI5 Please:

How do we hear sound? I thought space was silent since it’s a vacuum. 
---------
I know it’s not generally considered a big deal, but I absolutely love how an astronaut will pass over in single-digit seconds an area that would take a normal person days to walk across.

I’m a simple man like that.

Let’s take a moment to appreciate the hundreds of people working without pay to keep these guys alive. 
---------
There is a wonderful book by Mary Roach called *Packing for Mars* and that touches on how disorienting this is. Apparently, It's really rough on the ISS and especially EVA spacewalks. I mean look at this video. How disorienting would it be to look down and see hundreds of miles between you and the Earth? You know you're weightless, but you're brain still thinks you might just fall all the way down.
---------
So fucking scary and amazing at the same time. I would give almost anything to be able to get up there. 
---------
Caught myself thinking "wish it wasn't a wide angle lens." 

Then I realized nitpicking about HD footage of the Earth from space is one of the stupidest things I could be doing.

Man space looks so sterile, calm and "safe" while Earth looks unreal like some mirage.

Amazing video.
---------
Our planet is so beautiful. And so are you, person reading this. You're amazing :)
---------
Fyi the fisheye makes them seem higher than they really are. You can’t see an entire hemisphere from ISS altitude
---------
It’s just insane that the idea of space exist, that we exist with the idea that we should never have known it existed, that Against all odds we’ve discovered another level of existence that challenges everything we knew about our beliefs and reality.
---------
This is the most casual space video I think I've seen. It just seems like an average day of maintenance on the ship. I can almost hear him complaining about work under his breath, like "damnit, got stuck with space duty this week. Shit, I dropped my wrench." There's something really cool about that. 
---------
I’m not religious but when I see shit like this it makes me think what the fuck, like what the actual fuck is going on right now, we live on a floating rock in space, how is this even a thing 
---------

I love how when humanity figured out how to seal ourselves in a tin can and attach ourselves to a bomb to get to space, our next priority was to get out of the tin can and walk around.   Just bad ass.  
---------
Our exceptional small blue dot floating in a violent and hostile universe. I cannot imagine the immense sense of humility and awe this brave men and women feel when doing this. Thank you so much in the name of the living beings down here on planet Earth.
---------
I could never be an astronaut. Seeing the earth from that vantage point would drive me into an existential crisis. 
---------
I wonder if people of that caliber still have to say "lefty loosey, righty tighty" in their heads when turning screws and doing maintenance up there.

One of my greatest hopes is that commercial space flight will happen and become cheap enough that I can see this view in person at least once in my lifetime. 
---------
what's crazy to think about is it kind of feels like it's just really high up above the earth, but you have to realize that it's so high up *there's literally no air outside* *and it is pure vacuum*. it's not even "cold" from an Earth atmosphere sense, it's cold because it's literally the blank void of space.

it'll be really crazy when in 10 years they do these spacewalks with VR cams (pretty please D:). the earth looks comparatively 2D from this single camera view; there must be an unbelievable, *soul-shaking* sense of *depth* looking down at Earth from all the way up there.

There's no reason for an astronaut to fear death when their already in heaven.

I would like him to turn around and look at whats behind him. We only ever get to see their perspective looking at the earth. I wanna see the other way, the emptiness of space behind him.  Kinda like the saying dont look down but instead dont look behind you. 
---------
Our home. One of the main reasons we should have tourists in LEO. Once you see our planet as a whole, it is difficult to believe in borders and walls. We are one species - All of our wars, and perceived differences mean nothing from this distance. 
---------
Maybe a dumb question but do commercial electronics work in space? Like provided it was encased with some temperature protection, could you just bring a Nikon or Olympus camera up there and snap a bunch of pictures. 

If I was an astronaut, I'd be snapping pictures left right and centre, even if only out the window of the station. I guess I'm saying I'm surprised I don't see a lot more stuff like this.
---------
Can anyone help me understand why I don’t see any stars in the background? I know most of the screen is Earth itself but I would at least expect to see a lot “bright dots” - for lack of better word - around the edges of Earth 

P.S. I promise I’m not a conspiracy theorist when it comes to anything Earth-related, just genuinely curious lol

So many superhero movies these days. These are the real Guardians of the Galaxy! I look up to these astronauts far more as Heroes than the characters on movies.

Sublime, no other word can accurately describe this view, just sublime

Seen this video on SciManDan's YouTube video about a moron who thinks it was fake.

I feel like it would be so hard to be productive with that gorgeous distraction floating by right underneath your workspace.

Seeing this just made me smile. I wish I could one day see our little rock from more of a third person perspective. Even being in space alone must me such a strange thing. 
---------
Does anyone know what continent they are passing over also what ocean they are over also? 
It always interest me to identify the part of earth from space and how to do it precisely also. 
---------
If you ever feel like you're meaningless, remember that this gif has sound.
---------
That must be so amazing and so terrifying at the same time
---------
This is the first time I've gotten a sense of just how damn *fast* the thing is moving. I've seen it pass overhead, but watching an entire continent drift on by below is truly awe-inspiring.
---------
I wonder if you send somebody to space who was scared of heights, would they panic? Or would they mentally treat the ISS as the landmass.
---------
Stuff like this always blows my mind could watch this for days. 
---------
I wish we took better care of that beautiful blue marble... 
---------
I would like to think I'd be all cool and level headed. But I was scared just looking at the video
---------
It's equal parts inspiring and terrifying.

Incredible, seeing the continents pass you by like bushes on a drive. Mad to see the entire shape of the planet before you like a picture. And without all the light from it I'm certain every star we know and more we don't are visible in the void.

But knowing that this one rope is securing you to something that's moving at seven kilometres per SECOND. And if that rope fails, you'll either fall to Earth and burn up on re-entry, becoming ashfall, or you'll just float off into space until you choke, or die from hypothermia or 3rd degree burns.

Or you get hit by a piece of space dust and decompress. It's sobering. That's the only thing I can think that makes astronauts sit up and pay attention to what they're doing. But I'd be overwhelmed. I can't begin to imagine how much training and psychological evaluation these people have to go through. They're the peak, highest echelon of society. 
---------
I got a little carried away replying to another comment, asking about why we can seemingly only see a fraction of a continent on the surface, even though it looks like we should be able to see half of the Earth surface. I.e. why can we only see Mexico. I thought the answer ended up interesting enough that maybe others would like to read it, so I'm repeating it here.

&#x200B;

Here's my initial reply, along with a lengthy explanation and my extremely bad math proving that the initial claim of only being able to see 3% of the surface from the ISS, is in fact *^((roughly, probably))* correct.

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------

&#x200B;

You can only see a fraction of the surface from the astronauts distance - you're actually only able to see about 3% of the surface at any point. Which is not a lot.

&#x200B;

It's kinda logical to think that you "should" be able to see half of the surface - but that doesn't really work out. You would have to be infinitely far away from the Earth to be able to see one entire half of the surface.

&#x200B;

Think of it like a large ball, and a lamp shade. If the lamp shade is really really close to the surface of the ball - the shade only covers a tiny part of the ball, really. That's kinda like the field of vision the astronauts have of the Earth. Remember they're not very far up - only about 400 kilometers above the surface, while the Earth (so, the ball) is a massive 12'742 kilometers in diameter. They're kinda skimming the surface, in the grand scheme of things!

&#x200B;

Hope that helps.

&#x200B;

*Edit: So I got a little obsessed and made a CAD drawing to illustrate, also I* r/theydidthemath

So here we go.

[https://i.imgur.com/NaF7WN5.png](https://i.imgur.com/NaF7WN5.png)

This is accurate scale. The inner blue circle here is the diameter of the Earth (12742 km). The dashed red circle is the orbit of the International Space Station. I'm using 400km altitude here, it does actually vary a bit, but it seems a reasonable average.

On the right, you can see lines going out from a point on the ISS orbit. Imagine that this point is the location of the ISS. The pink lines go outwards towards the Earth's horizon. This is the limit to how far you can see. If you stretch the pink lines any further, they just go back into space - so, that is your local horizon. Now, this looks like a lot more than 3% - but remember in reality, it's 3 dimensional, the surface area of the Earth is huge.

For funs, let's make an awful approximation of how many square kilometers of the Earth we can see from the ISS.

Remembering that the Area of the sphere is `4 π r2` we arrive at an area of \~510'072'000  sq kilometers (I'll call that 510 million km^(2)) for the Earth, assuming it's a sphere with a radius of 12'742 / 2 =  6'371 km.

The formula for calculating the distance to the local horizon is something like `Sqrt(altitide * (2*Radius+altitude))` which, plugging in the numbers for ISS altitude and radius of the Earth, gives us `Sqrt(400 * (2*6371+400))` which gives us a distance to the Earth's horizon, looking from the ISS, to be approximately `~2292.7km`. This means, we can, at most, see \~2292 kilometers in any direction along the Earth surface, from the ISS.

Now we can imagine that we can draw a circle with a radius of 2292.7km, which will give us a \*terrible\* estimate for how large an area of the Earth we can see. It's terrible because we're not accounting for the curvature of the earth, but it's close enough. The area of a circle is `πr2`, so plugging in the numbers gives us the result \~16'513'697km^(2).

16513697 / 510072000 = 0.032 = 3%. Which, is the number I gave at the top of this comment, before I did any actual math.

Proven!

OK I'll show myself out the back door now...
---------
I wonder if they know what country they’re over or at least seeing 
---------
Thank you so much for posting this OP. Even watching it for a few seconds makes me remember that all of my “problems”, in the grand scheme of things, are actually quite minor. What a beautiful planet we live on! 
---------
If this was FB there'd be a bunch of FE'ers hollering that this video is fake and is CGI. 
---------
I've scrolled past this a few times and thought "meh it's just space footage" and then it eventually occurred to me that oh my this is space footage. I have become worryingly blasé about wondrous things. Also the whole video I had the feeling the person would fall down. 
---------
I hate heights so as beautiful as this is, it's my worst nightmare
---------
I trust you were wearing the orange suit during liftoff?
---------
Your videos helped convince me to fly in from Canada for this launch. It was my first and won't be my last. I'm still in Titusville in fact. Spent today checking out the various (public) spots I've seen launch photos taken from.

Thank you for being awesome! Keep it up!

That's incredible! I was there as well, about 7 miles from the launchpad and it's so cool to see a different perspective.


The part that surpris**e**d me the most about the launch were the boosters landing. It was like thunder you could feel, as I was only 3 miles away from the landing! 🚀 
---------
I drove down from my hometown in Iowa to Kennedy Space Center in Florida to cover the Falcon Heavy launch as credentialed media for my [Everyday Astronaut YouTube Channel](http://YouTube.com/everydayastronaut) and my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/everydayastronaut). It was incredible!!!

I was standing 3.17 miles (5 km) away from the launch at the press site and it was just spectacular. I’ll be posting my reaction video and post launch analysis on my channel as well.

Hey I just found your youtube channel! I love your videos, they were very informative on the plans SpaceX has for the future and some of the technical details of their booster recovery operation. Thanks for all your hard work!!

Also lovely shot :) I'm a photographer myself so I can imagine how exciting it must have been to get to see something like this and photograph it.
---------
The whole spacex initiative makes me feel like a kid again. I love it. I hope this is what my dad felt like during the first trips to space. Such an awesome event.
---------
I remember seeing you on TMRO a couple years ago, seeing your Instagram in it’s infancy, and wondering if you’d really make this work out long term. But, man, your YouTube channel has really exploded the past few months with the great work you’re doing. Keep it up!
---------
/u/everydayastronaut any chance you have a wider version that would work as a wallpaper? 
---------
Tim.. this photo is awesome. The detail is superb. Congrats on capturing a great historical moment. 
---------
A Chrome plugin tells me that distance is approximately the diameter of Pluto.
---------
Yeah, but I walked 500 miles and I walked 500 more just fall down at some bint's door.

Kidding. Fantastic shot, pal.
---------
I saw your Tesla commercial on the local news. I think you should get some credit for Starman!
---------
This is the America I love. Reaching out for the future. An inspiration to the planet.

---------
One day, this photo will be remastered with hardcore technology and sold in history text books. 
---------
This is the equivalent of Girls Gone Wild for a Rocket enthusiast.

What a wonderful image!!

It reminds me of how I felt as a kid watching NASA launch Space Shuttles.

I remember seeing a Space Shuttle strapped to the 747 and when I was on a plane heading to the US (forget what year) we were able to see a shuttle launch far in the distance.

We live in amazing times regardless of what people might say.
Space travel is truly inspiring for humanity.

Anyone know what the water tower on the right is full of? It might be water but idk what they would need water for 
---------
Here a Spanish dude thanking you for the conversion to the metric system, RESPECT👊
---------
Thank you for acknowledging the rest of the world that uses the metric system. 
---------
Love your channel dude. Keep it up
---------
Just set this as my iPhone lock screen. Thanks!
---------
This is a picture that will live in history forever. Thank you for your efforts; the Earth thanks you.
---------
I clicked this post to get the same image. Who's the real winner here?
---------
Nice! You also have amazing videos! 
---------
that's a damn nice picture
---------
Such a great shot Tim. The sense of scale is unreal
---------
Great work, Tim!
---------
The dedication is real 
---------
Sensational photo Tim! Would you mind if I asked what camera you use? 
---------
Upvote for the piccy as well as the metric conversions. 
---------
If only there was a way to make it a 3440x1440p wallpaper...
---------
Gonna screen shot that, blow it up and have it framed...thanks for doing all the hard work! 
---------
This is going to be on the cover of an overpriced science textbook in 15 years.
---------
Hey! Im one of your Youtube followers. I watched your live broadcast. Keep doing what you do. *Waving from the other side of the world!*
---------
Why didn't you just fly instead of putting almost 3k miles on your car? Isn't that like 3 full days of driving?
---------
You drove 1400 miles? Ugh that's brutal, if only there was some sort of airborne craft that could've gotten you there faster. Anywho, cool picture of the rocket!
---------
I sat at home and watched it in the corner of a Runescape livestream.. but your way is cool too i spose..
---------
Does someone know how or can someone get him to do an AMA?
---------
Ahhh, that steam coming off it, contrasted with the insanely hot fuel burning. Great photo.
---------
Anyone have a photo of the rocket boosters after coming back to the ground?
---------
Wow! For us camera nerds - can you give some specs on your camera? Shutter speed / aperture please! 
---------
Amazing photo, 

can anyone tell me what the white gas is surrounding the rocket? (Not the exhaust, it looks like liquid nitrogen or something)
---------
Awesome.

How many shots did you fire during the fist couple of seconds :)?
---------
Love your channel man, you're doing some awesome work getting people excited about space and the private space industry. Keep it up!
---------
This is awesome.
---------
Why is the rocket covered in steam/smoke/mist?
---------
This is so cool!
---------
My god cx that's pretty much the length of New Zealand cx
---------
Killer pic. You really nailed it. 
---------
Bravo, your time and effort was worth it.  Amazing photograph.
---------
I cannot imagine the logistics it took you to figure out exposure settings for this photo. As a photographer myself, congratulations. 
---------
I moved to orlando recently and i know someone that works for nasa. He was able to get a car pass for us so we loaded up 7 people in my suburban and went there for the day. We were about 3 miles from the launchpad. It was one of the most breathtaking moments of my life watching that rocket liftoff and seeing the boosters land. Something i will never forget.
---------
Are private aerospace companies required to put US flags on their rockets?
---------
Why does the very top of  the rocket look out of tilt? Or is it just me? You have too zoom in. 
---------
Did you copy the way you have astronaut from the Bad Astronaut albums?
---------
So what would happen to a person who was that close to the launch? Would it just be dangerously loud? Is it close enough for heat to be an issue?
---------
What's the closest you can stand to a rocket launch without getting hurt? (obviously there's a much larger safe zone in case of an explosion.
---------
This whole time I thought the car was strapped to the outside of the rocket. 🤦‍♂️
---------
Love the American flag at the top. Leading the way toward past, present, and future space exploration. 
---------
Beautiful! Absolutely perfect shot.
Memories last a lifetime- and then some.
---------
The most elaborate photo of a Tesla Roadster ever taken
---------
Plus look at all these internet points you are getting!
---------
Did anyone capture it in 4K60fps, holy crap that would be amazing 
---------
I would do the same but never would have gotten such a beautiful picture. Good shot!
---------
Is that a Falcon Heavy or are you just happy to see me? 
---------
Was the American flag compulsory? Like would the government only let Musk shoot his rocket off into space if he had their logo on it? 
---------
And here I am just watching it from my backyard. 
---------
I watched it my whole lunch period. I got super lucky, it launched at 2:40 i had lunch 2:30-3:00....the boosters landing at the same time blew my mind
---------
Jesus Christ.  What did it feel like being in proximity.  Like heat and preassure or what?
---------
Bravo, man. What an achievement. I’m on my phone and I was zooming in and panning around looking at the stunning detail... 

Level with the second from bottom railing on the water tower, among the smoke to the left, there’s one tiny white dot. What could that be, you think? Debris? Just a sparkle of light reflected off something behind the smoke? I just thought it looked cool how it could be seen through all that smoke. 
---------
Does anyone else find the clouds of steam (that is steam, right?) super r/oddlysatisfying?
---------
That is an instant classic shot. Congratulations. 
---------
One of the Best Falcon Heavy launch photo I have seen till now. Anymore pic of this event?
---------
I kust walked 500 biles and then I walked 500 more...
---------
This is one of the best photographs I've seen, honestly, the angle and all is perfect. You even got the text on the water tower to essentially directly face you! US flag, tick, support falling back, tick, rocket infront of big cloud, tick,hole in the side of the mound, tick, slope, tick.

Dude.
---------
Is there anyway that we can download this in high resolution for a wallpaper?
---------
This is the best shot of the launch I've seen! Absolutely perfect.

Your 360 video during the launch was pretty sweet too.
---------
IMO this is the best photo yet from this launch.
---------
Oh it's you! Nice YT channel man. And I'm so envious of your space stuff collections!

Somehow I'm more impressed that you drove that far!
---------
Does anyone know what that SpaceX tower is for? 
---------
absolutely fantastic
---------
Definitely well worth it! Also appreciate the conversion to metric!
---------
Just curious. Say the launch didn’t go as planned and the rocket blew up on the pad, would the fireball reach out to a 1/4 mile?  My money is on yes. 
---------
"Power overwhelming"
---------
Not very many people can witness history first hand
---------
how'd you get that close?
---------
Do you have any other pictures?
---------
Awesome. 
---------
Best picture I've seen of the launch, amazing job.
---------
Wow. Thanks, That is beautiful! 
---------
This is so good it looks like it was drawn, very rich textures I must say (especially from the smoke). 

It's a high five and a James Brown shriek from me!
---------
What lens did you use for this?
---------
Wow, could you make this into a background?
---------
What a gorgeous shot.

Settings and what kinda PP do you do?
---------
I watched the launch from 13mi away in Cocoa. The rocket was intensely bright 30 seconds into the flight, almost like looking at the sun. How bright was it from your view? Can your really feel the heat from it?
---------
Did you drive a tesla???
---------
What an amazing shot!
---------
Amazing photo.  Is there a reason you couldn't fly there?
---------
Terrific 
---------
Wonderful shot!
---------
Wonderful shot! Great work! 
---------
[deleted]
---------
An my shorty metal band use this as our album art?

We suck though.
---------
We were glad to be able to see the launch live truly a historic moment your photo is amazing as well!
---------
That's a pretty epic picture. Always wanted to see a live launch. Plan to go see one over around Los Angeles. Need to see if any particular one this year might be a more impressive launch, bc otherwise, getting that checked off the bucket list this year
---------
That photo is FANTASTIC! Thank you for sharing!
---------
It really was incredible to watch (I watched the live feed) as someone that has never really been into rockets and the like... I think this has me wanting to see a launch in person now.  Great picture!
---------
Your photo is now a beautiful piece of history. 
---------
I really feel like you need a better watermark...  it's a beautiful shot, but now anyone can use it for their own..

Was it hard to gain access to the field to video tape it? 
---------
The FOX film lot looks different this far away
---------
Oh I thought you would be on the roof of that massive building with the rest of the photographers. I thought that's where the press location was.

Was that just some exclusive invite only thing? (Saw it SmarterEveryDay)
---------
I love what you do and wish I could be apart of it! As a photographer, what lens was this shot with?
---------
Outstanding picture op.
---------
When OP uses both imperial and metric units in the title. This I like. 
---------
Brilliant photo. Well done.
---------
Just do what you want!

---------
Amazing. Have an upvote and this pic can get straight on my desktop.
---------
Probably stupid question, but what’s the steam/smoke/vapor coming from the rocket?

Edit: phrasing makes me seem like an idiot. I’ll leave it in, but I mean the smoke from the sides along the stage, not from the butt end of the rocket. 
---------
Excellent shot
---------
Couldn't you have taken a flight?
---------
Thank you for this. I was about 75 miles away, at home, with no real way to get closer - but I could see the engine glow and some trails.. Wish you could have been around for the shuttle launches.

If my roomir weren't such an ass I'd invite you to couch surf so you could be closer to launches.
---------
Amazing shot! Totally worth it. Thanks for sharing it with us! Keep it up! 
---------
I just found your videos two days ago because I wanted to find out about those grid fins. You‘re content is awesome! Keep it up.
---------
I would like to see a perspective view space X falcon heavy against the Saturn five just to see the scale of the rockets
---------
After Falcon Heavy landed that i noticed im so fucking happy to be alive at this time.
---------
Hey!

[I have a picture of you saved for my wallpaper :D](https://imgur.com/a/mNn5G)

Dope picture dude! 


---------
Still very amazed that a guy who helped make e-purchases now blasts his own sports car into the atmosphere on a super powerful rocket his other company owns.  What a time to be alive...or is it?
---------
This is an incredible photo. I can only imagine what it was like to experience this in person.
---------
This is amazing! I watched it live and I cried. I can’t even begin to imagine what it was like actually watching it 
---------
I think I saw this picture on smarter every day?  It's an amazing picture!  Perfection,
---------
Amazing. Do you have to pay to get somewhere near the landing pad. Considering flying from australia for the BFR (or if the heavy launches again).

---------
Damn this picture is in such beautiful quality. Straight crispy.
---------
Great pic buddy. Any chance you have a higher res pic for a wallpaper...?
---------
*sees picture*

hmm i wonder if that's an everyday astronaut photo

*sees name*

haha yes

edit: yeah i missed the watermark
---------
Look at that American flag on the tip of that rocket penis. Damn glorious 
---------
Space chick: Elon come over

Elon: Not now, I'm trying to colonize foreign planets

Space chick: If you come now I'll let you colonize my foreign planet

Elon: ......

*straps model s to rocket*
---------
That's the most incredulous thing I've ever seen
---------
What's the smoke along the rocket during liftoff? 
---------
Thank you to skilled and driven photographers like yourself for providing us with such amazing photos! 
---------
If you weren't wearing the orange suit while you did it, then you're doing your job wrong
---------
Hey what settings did you use to shoot this photo? 
---------
What kind of credentials do you have to have to gain access to leave a camera there? 
---------
great pic dude and a great channel on youtube, keep it up!
---------
Thanks for the new desktop background image! I'm a geotechnical engineer so my focus is on the ground but I love what SpaceX has been doing and I try to follow every launch!
---------
And here I was not knowing anything about this until I saw space car memes 3 days later. 
---------
I just realized that the Falcon Heavy is flipping us off. F you, you falcon rocket! 
---------
Is that a water tower worryingly close to the launch pad?
---------
How did you get so close? I saw a spacex launch in 2016 in orlando and couldnt get anywhere near 1500 ft of it. maybe a couple miles?
---------
Oh man I LOVE your youtube videos. Just an FYI. Huge fan. 

also nice picture.
---------
The water tower is a good reference for size! You're so lucky to have gotten this shot! 
---------
On the technical side of things, what did you use to trigger the camera?  Great photos love your channels!
---------
I'd love to buy this print for my garage, but I suspect you're going to be back ordered for sometime lol 
---------
I live on Merritt Island. I'm so lucky, I got to see it from my backyard. Such an intense shaking!
---------
What's in the elevated tank? Just water for spraying on the launchpad, or is it fuel? I've been wondering where they store the fuel and oxygen.
---------
Anyone have a good HD background of the launch? Or of Spaceman?
---------
I wish, I am that rocket. So many people can share my pic.
---------
Your channel is going to explode with SpaceX becoming more mainstream.  

Get ready to hit that million subscriber mark! 
---------
Can someone tell me how hot it would be at that distance?
---------
I discovered your channel during the launch. I subscribed!
---------
[removed]
---------
Brilliant pic thank you for sharing it with us. 
❤ PTU xxx 
---------
Sweet! Check lower right part of photo. It looks like construction on Falcon Mini is almost completed. Im excited to see the potential it has 
---------
Beautiful shot and composition!  Thanks for sharing!!😁
---------
So what makes this rocket such a game changer... is it because it produces more thrust than previous rocket designs?
---------
Incredible shot. So much of what I've seen looks so sureal...I feel like there will be a bunch of people denying that this was real. Glad to see another viewpoint!
---------
I'm really excited about the space x launch facility coming down to deep south texas by the gulf of Mexico.  It will be about an hours drive to be able and witness a launch.
---------
Elon musk is 3 rockets away from the science victory
---------
This was an amazing accomplishment; but i find you the real MVP for referencing the metric system, so us human could understand the distance! 


---------
They dropped a building 20 stories tall, from space, and landed it gently on an X.
---------
Never gets old.
---------
Not sure how many oldsters like myself here- I remember the first lunar landing as a kid.  Oddly enough, this is the stuff of '40s and '50s science fiction- Asimov, Bradbury, Heinlein, Clarke, et al.  I'm bowled over seeing their imaginary 'rocket ships' come into being.
---------
It’s videos like this that make me realize how very little I know about anything. 
---------
I enjoyed the technical broadcast. They stayed with that long view from the stage 1 separation, and burn back. Really neat to see it from the ground. 
---------
Still going to take some time for my brain to adapt and realize that these videos aren’t just a traditional launch played in reverse.
---------
It is astounding to see a rocket land upright like that. Lest we forget, think of how incredibly difficult a technical feat it is to *launch* a rocket.
---------
I remember every single launch I've watched Live and each one floors me. These people are mad scientists. 20 years from now things like Sky Cranes and self landing decent stages will be taken for granted, and I am absolutely fine with that.
---------
Absolutely amazing. Bravo!
---------
This video really captures how crazy the feat is. It's really clear that it is just a big cylinder just falling out of the sky and then moments later gently lands on the X
---------
Those angles are becoming my favorite. The smoke gives a nice sense of how sporty the reentry is.
---------
Holy fucking shit. Being alive for this stuff is pretty darn neat
---------
I love that this doesn't seem that impressive anymore, more like 'yeah, of course it landed'.

10 years ago this was essentially science fiction.
---------
God damnit they're smart. Who the fuck thinks to fly a rocket backwards? 
---------
Always amazed to see how humanity is one step closer to leaving the cradle.
---------
I love how you can see it sideslipping, those grid fins sure work magic! 
---------
Man, Kerbal Space Program is looking more and more realistic by the day.
---------
I kind of want to see this reversed and have the take off play next to each other.
---------
This impressive technological advancement is overshadowed only by the staggering increase in the length of gifs. 
---------
[deleted]
---------
I heard Machine Learning is used in every mission so it always gets better at landing. Can anyone confirm this?
---------
I still can't wrap my head around how awesome this is. I had The Last Jedi soundtrack playing in the background while watching this clip, and it straight up made it feel like a scene out of a sci-fi film. What a time to be alive!
---------
I'm 45 years old and I have seen every crazy scifi movie, looney toons cartoon and anime and said landing rockets like that is bullshit. Elon Musk has made me realize im a moron....
---------
I'm actually tearing up. I haven't watched any of the SpaceX launch/landing clips yet so I had no idea what to expect. That was so insanely graceful, I can't believe how precise and controlled that landing was.
---------
Who would have thought that one day we'd be able to fly rockets backwards.
---------
"No big deal, just landing a building real quick."

Seriously though. This has become normal and it's magnificent. I remember playing Starcraft as a kid and thinking buildings could only launch like a spacecraft and land somewhere else in science fiction. It may not be exactly the same thing but it sure is damn close. 
---------
The amount of math that must go into this baffles me.
---------
An accomplishment that will be viewed on par with first air flight one day. Amazing!
---------
What's hard to imagine, is that this is close to the size of the statue of liberty... falling from space and landing perfectly... it's just so bizarre. 
---------
All things considered, that is fucking amazing
---------
They should name one of their rockets Kerri Strug because it sticks the landing.
---------
The fact that a man imagined this is great, the fact that he made his imagination reality is even greater.
---------
All the white smoke before the engine ignited, is it fuel from precooling the engine?
---------
Source/sauce: https://youtu.be/wwMDvPCGeE0?t=1h6m7s
---------
I catch so much flack on Reddit for being a SpaceX fan boy but God I love watching this company succeed. It is one of the few bits of my generation that I think is trying to push humanity forward
---------
Wait can someone please explain for the ignorant over here? This is the part that breaks off after launch right? I thought these pieces crashed in the ocean, not made a perfect landing on a pad!? 
---------
And this, my friends, is why that even if Solar City, Tesla and Space X all go bankrupt tomorrow, Elon Musk will always have my respect and admiration. He single handedly brought back the American "Dream Big" attitude back to at least some part of the country. I guess it took a South African to remind us how it's done.
---------
Fucking bravo to the engineers. It has the same effect on me as seeing a magician trick but better because it also restores faith in humanity.
---------
I wish my grandfather had been alive to see this. He was the project manager for the J-2 (on the Saturn V) and manager of test operations at Santa Susana as well as the President of the Tulsa division of Rockwell. He would’ve found this to be so amazing. 
---------
The NASA folks from the 60's must crap their pants when they watch this.
---------
This is an amazing gif, but THIS video of stage seperation is my favorite part of the live stream the other day:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPHbqY9LHCs&feature=youtu.be&t=1078

This looks so insane.  From a first person perspective up there it was cool, but holy shit this looks even more amazing.
---------
I feel Iike they played a lot of KSP and just said "wait let's do this in real life"
---------
This looks soo fake. Like something out of an old school sci fi movie, but then it's real and the future is today and it makes me happy!
---------
Am i the only one noticing the camera guy’s phenomenal work? He was locked onto that thing going crazy speeds, and it was zoomed in. Crazy. 
---------
The video doesn't do the power and precision justice. Watching the first successful return to land at Kennedy through binoculars brought tears to my eyes. The future is coming, and it is beautiful.
---------
Every time I see stuff like this I think maybe... just maybe we're not doomed as a species.  This is humanity at its best.
---------
Went on a tour of the space center that day, got to see the space x hangar AND the vehicle assembly building. Shit is AWESOME
---------
30 years ago you'd never believe a rocket would be made to land in such a way. Truly stranger than fiction. 
---------
that wasn't as accurate as usual. was off the centre by a whole six feet.
---------
[deleted]
---------
That was amazing. Never saw It before.  After the landing I thought it was looped in reverse or something. 
---------
I passed by spacex yesterday on a work trip and outside is a frame of a falcon 9... It's so much bigger than I expected. It makes these videos even more incredible to watch now. 
---------
I'm so lucky I got to tour SpaceX and what blew me away was their carbon fiber creation. I had no idea how many uses carbon fiber had beyond just a light durable material
---------
I used to want to see a rocket launch,  forget that boring stuff! Show me a rocket landing! Amazing!
---------
Wow holy shit this actually happened in like real life?
---------
I never tire of these videos. It's a motherfucking rocket, returning from space, landing backwards on a space the size of a tennis court.
---------
Makes me wonder why so many people have no interest in space exploration. Omg it’s so cool and this is just a glimpse of how cool it can be. In a few years we can have multiple probes sent to space for exploration for the fraction of the cost. 
---------
"Colonel, you better take a look at this radar."  
"What is it son?"  
"I don't know sir, but it looks like a giant..."
---------
This is so unbelievably cool. I am so greatful to be alive at this point in time and witness stuff like this
---------
When launching model rockets back in the day, not having the parachute get stuck in a tree was enough to get excited about. Makes me wonder what Elon like to do for fun when his schedule is clear and he’s all alone. 
---------
I will never stop being completely mesmerized by watching these videos. It's like magic, only it comes from the brains of some pretty awesome people. 
---------
I can't wait until I don't care about seeing this. Means it's totally commonplace. 
---------
Wow I did not know they landed like that. I just thought they crash landed into the ocean. Color me amazed. 
---------
This is just incredible. I've watched like six times and  can still barely process it.
---------
I saw this live! (Through streaming, not irl lol). The whole thing was astounding but this landing blew me away. They sent a rocket into space, sent it thousands of miles across the planet, and it still somehow landed gently and safely, upright, exactly where they wanted it to. Smart people are wild
---------
It looks like it's coming from outer space , I mean from alien civilization 
---------
I was expecting a parachute... then I was like, "holy crap, theyre just gonna use that rocket (?) to land it?!"...

Then they landed it on a fucking TARGET/launchpad and I was like "oh gtfo, are you kidding??!" 
---------
Remember, folks: the first stage of a falcon 9 is **135 feet tall** (41m).

That aint no toy. It's the height of a **13 story building**.

[Here's a pic of some people near the base.](https://fsmedia.imgix.net/1d/8d/8c/94/286b/45f4/94d4/edfff0ce4c36/comment4wehomrle79utxlypqvm4ixdojlhfdfhjpg.jpeg)

Now imagine landing THAT thing.
---------
Does anyone feel like... "Damn this the future"?
---------
And to think, Elon’s hero- Aldrin was his biggest critic. Testified before Congress that spacex shouldn’t be allowed to do this because it’s too dangerous. Elon cried when confronted with the video of Aldrin’s condemnation. 
---------
Nothing but crickets from the folks who typically have nothing positive to say about SpaceX, Elon Musk, and the whole New Space/Commercial Space sector.

"The F9 is just rehashing everything the DC-X did first and better before most SpaceX so-called engineers were out of diapers". Yeah, no.
---------
How does it stay upright?
---------
I'm not an engineer by any means, but watching this just blows my mind on what these engineers have done.  Unreal
---------
Thank the gods for the inspired people who make this sort of thing a reality.

Last week I remembered to put the garbage out on the correct night.

Looks like we've all kicked a goal. Well done, humanity. 
---------
I'll give it a 9 out of 10 because they are a bit off center on the landing pad!
---------
I’m so happy there are people this smart out there. Gives me hope for humanity. 
---------
It doesn't even look real how smoothly it lands. These people are wizards in my eyes. 
---------
I never really realized exactly how impressive that is before 
---------
Yesterdays launch has amazing shots.

After the 1st stage separation you could see the booster flip and to a burn to slow down and start it's journey back.

It was such a clear day as the booster was coming down from the on board camera you could see the smoke trail from the launch, it was pretty great camera work.

It was the 2nd flight for the booster and the Dragon capsule it launched.  So it was the first successful reuse of a booster to land.
---------
Un-fucking-real.

Love watching this. space-X kicks ass
---------
I wish I lived where I could see a night sky like that.
---------
Okay, so I saw this from the same location that you did. That's the bay, isn't it? My girlfriend didn't think it was anything special, but I swore it was Mars!

I need to show this to her.
---------
About a week ago I got a similar (albeit way less detailed) picture of Venus:

https://i.imgur.com/7X8pbRP.jpg

I'd never seen it so bright it was reflecting on the water (Lake Ontario in this case.) 
---------
Mars is bright tonight.
---------
i dont think ive ever seen the milky way with my naked eye. honestly when i look up at night i dont even see stars that much
---------
I live in Rhode Island and it is more shocking to me that Rhode Island made the front page. 
---------
I was wondering why Mars has been so bright lately
---------
In Rhode Island, it’s pronounced “Mahz”

Great photo!
---------

---------
Always awesome to have some Rhose Island love on Reddit, there's dozens of us! Amazing picture!
---------
Beautiful.  I live in North Kingstown and can never see anything like this.  
---------
RI native here, where was the photo taken from? Really curious, because I may have to take a trip over to this spot at some point to do some stargazing 
---------
I’m an astrophotographer and there’s plenty more [on my instagram right here](http://www.instagram.com/advil) 🌌🌌


if you’re wondering why it’s unusually bright, it’s because Mars is nearly at opposition right now. It wont be this close again til 2035. learn more here https://www.space.com/40588-mars-at-opposition.html

Exif is:

I fund my gear 100% through selling prints, this particular one is here if you're interested: https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/abdul/mars-over-rhode-island/
---------
Rhode Island is my home state :) Pretty picture!
---------
OP - I’m also in RI, what time of night to look for Mars?
---------
I’m from RI and to be clear, the sky does not look like this with the naked eye. You can practically see lights from Providence on a cloudy night in most of the state lol New Hampshire is great for stargazing, if you’re in NE. 
---------
All the planets have been very bright this year--I notice when I go out at night.

Quick tip for anyone who casually stargazes: Stars twinkle and flicker, planets do not. If you see a light that's completely unmoving, it's a planet.
---------
I was unaware you could see the Milky Way in the north east. I really need to get deeper into the woods. 
---------
Mars is getting closer. What if Mars...attacks?
---------
Came home super late the other night and I saw a very bright orange glow high in the sky. I figured it was Mars since it wasnt moving, but I dont think I'd ever seen it, let alone so bright. It really was remarkable!
---------
All that's missing is some Art Bell on the radio.
---------
Hey OP, not trying to piggyback your post (I'm about 5 hours too late for that). I just wanted to show you [this shot](https://i.imgur.com/lVUS1gF.jpg) I took last night at Lake of Glass in RMNP. No moon, and Mars just about to set. This is pretty much converted from raw with almost no editing. 

I love that trail and the milky way in your shot, good job.
---------
Spent a few nights in a cabin by a lake up in Michigan earlier this month. I witnessed Mars rising, and it created a reflection just like this. My first night there, I would have sworn it was a traffic light for aircraft.
---------
This must be in South County, Narragansett maybe? I drive nights in RI, Mars is definitely prominent. Venus is looking hot as well.
---------
Now would be a good time to get Matt Damon back. Cheaper too. 
---------
Wow, I think i saw Mars last night. It was so bright, and because of its reddish hue i thought it couldn't have been a star... good to know!
---------
Mars reflection looks like a flare signaling us to come there.. 
---------
Rhode Islander here. We’re underrated 
---------
I was wondering why it looked so bright last night. 
---------
Omg, where? I live in Newport. Would love to see this!
---------
Can we have a 1920x1080 version of this image please. I wanted to set this as my desktop wallpaper. Those stars in the sky is so beautiful.
---------
I started noticing it like a week ago and thinking, "...the hell is that?" I had to google star maps to find out. And it's gonna get brighter and brighter all month.
---------
Bro where!?!? I'm from RI and I've never been able to see the stars like that! Truly incredible 
---------
There is NOTHING like summertime in Rhode Island.
---------
Wow, i miss the clear skies we had a few years ago in northern Quebec. Now today where i live, all we see is a few bright stars and the moon with a lot of light pollution. 
---------
Where in Rhode Island was this?? I’d love to see the Milky Way with the naked eye and I do (partly) live in Rhode Island! 
---------
It's taunting us.daring us to come to it, conquer it, make it home.
---------
I've been seeing Mars every morning before work and it always puts me in a better mood 
---------
Holy shit! I’m on the beach in Florida and was wondering which planet was so bright that it was reflecting on the ocean. 
---------
I've seen so many pictures like this where the night sky is absolutely beautiful. I live in India where there huge amounts of pollution both air and light so haven't see anything like that here. Can someone tell me if this is how it actually looks to the naked eye? Do you see the clouds in the milky way with magestic blue light and crazy arms of the spiral? If so then my life goal is to move to a place where this is in my backyard. 
---------
So that’s why I was able to see Mars a couple weeks ago. Got a pic of it next to the moon while out on my front lawn. Not a great pic, but better than I expected: https://i.imgur.com/kaCDueK.jpg

I even double-checked on my star map app just to be sure: https://i.imgur.com/pjRdYEf.jpg

Great pic, OP!
---------
This really makes me want to get away from all the light pollution in my city for a while.
---------
I saw it last night when I was camping in Flower Gap in the Shining Rock Wilderness. The clouds cleared away *just* enough for Mars to burn through. Absolutely stunning!
---------
to the future human internet "archaeologist" looking at this post while on mars... keep up the good work yall killin it ya damn martians
---------
Go pats baby, love your twitter feed. Cool to see you pop on Reddit too. Amazing photo by the way. 
---------
This looks awesome I love it
---------
Probably all the cockroaches doing something up there 
---------
Mars is pretty beautiful, but whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial land tank outside Rubicon. He's well protected. But with the right team we can punch through their defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---------
I’ve noticed it was super bright and was wondering why. This image is so damn cool.
---------
I’ve been wondering why it’s been so big and bright!
---------
To imagine we have a couple of robots over there. Amazing. Also amazing photo OP!
---------
Seen it the last couple nights and I couldnt figure out what it was. Thanks, guy on reddit for calming my curiosity! 
---------
lmaaAOOO hi abdul never thought i’d casually come across you on reddit
---------
I tweeted this photo and gave you picture credit through your reddit name. It’s my personal account and I make no money off it but if you’d like any other form of media to be advertised please let me know.

---------
The centaurs were right.
Mars is bright tonight.
---------
In 2003, around age 10, my parents took my sister and I camping on top of a mountain with an extremely clear night sky. (Dragoon Mountains, I believe, in Arizona/New Mexico). They told us Mars that night was especially bright, it even cast our shadows! 

Thank you for this very special post! 

My parents also said that night how it was the brightest mars would be in their lifetimes, our lifetimes, 40 years or like 100 years, anyone know? I was too young to remember
---------
That's a gorgeous pic, but I call BS on the whole Mars casting a light nonsense 🤣🤣
---------
So is that the orange/red star I've been seeing lately?
---------
I don't want too sound sure about this, because I'm not. But it looks more like the reflection of a streetlight or some other light bulb behind camera rather than mars' reflection. But, like I said...idk pretty shot, regardless.
---------
I once read an article (linked below) about people trying to capture a picture of a shadow cast by the planet Venus.  I wonder if Mars is ever bright enough for that to happen.

https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/28nov_venusshadows/
---------
My wife and I are in Maui and the first night we went to the beach Venus was casting a reflection in the ocean. I’d never seen a planet do that on a body of water. 
---------
Amazing shot. Thanks for the new screen saver for my phone 
---------
I live in RI and I'm often on my kayak in the middle of the night on the upper Narragansett bay....even on a clear beautiful night, being able to see more than a hint of the milkway just doesn't happen....what was the exposure time for your photo?


---------
Last time Mars was like this (2003), I remember wishing very strongly that there would be a power failure so I could see Mars and the sky without all the light pollution- and damn me if less than 24 hours later there WAS a HUGE power outage that  was one of the biggest ever in North America! I was more careful what I wished for after that!
---------
Did you have to correct for a lot of wide angle lens distortion?  The glitter path looks odd because it's going off to the left.  Usually a glitter path is on a vertical plane that runs through the object creating the glitter path and the viewer's eye (or camera lens in this case). 

For example, here's [a photo from the "Earth Science Picture of the Day](http://epod.usra.edu/blog/2010/09/crescent-moon-venus-and-glitter-paths.html)" website that has two glitter paths; one from the moon on the left and one from Venus on the right.  As can be seen there is a slight convergence of the two GPs inward toward the viewer.  Nice photo though.
---------
With Mars so close, we should remember that whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---------
I call BS, I live in RI and its been overcast past three nights.....
---------
Can you also explain that long exposure shots result in pictures like yours and that the naked eye sees nothing like this in reality. Your picture is beautiful but your title is deceptive.
---------
That is a stunning shot! 
---------
I saw Mars over the horizon last week in upstate NY and was stunned by the size. So beautiful.
---------
Fuck I was in RI 2 days ago.....was completely unaware....
---------
Beautiful photo. 

I am surprised that you didn't posted it on r/EarthPorn.
---------
I’ve been wondering this. It’s huge in the night sky. 
---------
Saw a bright light in the sky the other night, similar to what you capture.  Thought it was a planet but didn't know which.  It was really bright.
---------
My new background and now I got a little story to go with it. Thanks!
---------
Red sky at night, sailors delight! Confirmed early sailors were taught by Martians
---------
I’ve been unsure if that reddish dot in the sky is Mars or not. Thanks for clearing that up for me =]
---------
Spent a few nights in a cabin by a lake up in Michigan earlier this month. I witnessed Mars rising, and it created a reflection just like this. My first night there, I would have sworn it was a traffic light for aircraft.
---------
That is some Eye-of-Sauron/ Mt. Doom shit right there.
---------
The other night I got out my telescope to see Saturn, since it’s near opposition and bright. I point at the brightest glowing object in that general direction and there weren’t any rings?! Lol it was mars. I’m new to this...
---------
I won't even be able to see it because it's 40 degrees below the horizon :(
---------
I thought it looked unusually bright the other night, I had to get my phone out and use an app to double-check it was Mars.
---------
I swear I saw this earlier today. Either that or I'm a fucking time traveller, because I KNOW I saw this earlier today 
---------
This reminds me of when I visited Sedona, Arizona. It's a dark-sky city in the middle of nowhere, so the stars in general are already amazing. Drove about 40 minutes out into the country and turned off on a back road and just laid there to stargaze for a while. Hands down best view I've ever seen!
---------
I picked a bad month to move from the countryside to a city
---------
This is some mystic looking shit my man! awesome!
---------
Wow, this explains the huge red dot I've been following in the sky for the last few weeks.
---------
Nice picture.

Past week in Western Australia it's been clear and every morning it's been wonderful looking up at Mars, also Orion is up in the dark sky for us in the morning too which is another treat.
---------
Just sailed across the Atlantic and we used Mars for a lot of our celestial navigation because its so bright and prominent. It was so bright some nights the reflection would just barely illuminate the horizon. Very cool!
---------
You can’t see nearly as many stars where I live, but I used to work nights and I’d point out Jupiter Saturn and mars to people since they’ve all been in the sky around 2-3 am. Now I get to work at about 6 am so all I can show people is mars, but I still do my best to share that with my new coworkers :)
---------
My family was visiting Ocean City, MD over the 4th and we were flabbergasted by how bright it was. We didn't even know it was Mars at first until I pulled out a star viewing app to verify our guesses. Thanks for the amazing photo!
---------
Okay thats so fucking awesome, a planet reflecting light onto another planets surface, where it reflects off of its water? So awesome.
---------
Saw Mars rise yesterday in Denmark. It was so bright I thought it was a radio tower at first, except it kept rising haha
---------
Ive been watching the night sky for over a week and kept wondering how I dont remember a super red bright star being there before. Thought it was mars.. now I guess its a positive.
---------
My husband and I were in Italy a couple of weeks ago, in Monterosso al Mare in the Cinque Terre. We watched the moon rise over the Mediterranean and noticed a bright red dot in the sky. Pulled out SkyView and confirmed that yes, it was actually Mars. First time in our lives it has ever actually looked like the "Red" planet before.
---------
Man what an amazing picture, what camera and lens did you use? 

This is seriously just amazing to me 
---------
I am currently fighting to get a picture like this , it’s very hard to find a dark spot in Austria :/ 
---------
You can download a free app called dark sky watcher and it's a dark sky map and will show you the areas with the best Dark Skies the Milky Way is in the South Southwest so you want a dark sky in that direction and the camera does see more than your eye because you're doing a longer exposure and a lot of these are multiple multiple images stack together
---------
Ahhh so it was Mars that I saw while camping. It was pretty crazy to see it reflect off the water. 
---------
Went to mitzpe Ramon in the Negev desert in Israel last week for a star gazing tour - absolutely wonderful views of Mars and Jupiter, plus Saturn (right on the milky way!) and many constellations. Had I arrived a bit earlier I could have seen Venus... 
---------
As Marvin the Martian would say what a beautiful Mars I'm going to blow up Mars
---------
That's awesome, I pulled up my sky map app just last night to ID an unusually bright object that turned out to be Mars.
---------
I live in Ireland and I saw something like this a few nights ago. Very bright, orange glowing and quite low in the sky. Thought it was a plane at first but it didn't move. Then maybe a satelite.

Now I'm thinking this might be what I saw?
---------
This is amazing... From Boston & have lived in RI... Never seen anything like this up here. Good shit
---------
So that's what's in the sky right now!  Watching the final of world cup right now in Sabah,  Malaysia.  10:54pm right now. 


Edit :: added a word
---------
Where I live, there are 0 stars, none, not a single fucking one, I guess thats what i get for living in middle of 14 million people city...
---------
Hey, I enjoy your pics! 
Where in RI did you take this? It’s an awesome pic. I’m from MA and I spend a lot of time down there. 

---------
I know this question is always asked, but I forget.  Are the browns and blacks true colors or an artifact of the imaging process?
---------
Consider checking out [my other images on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cosmic.speck/) if you'd like, and my partner on this image (u/ajamesmccarthy) other works [can be found here on his instagram]( https://www.instagram.com/cosmic_background/ ) 

This image is a bit different from what I normally do as you may know. Most of my work centers around deep space photography, compared to this image of our very own moon, which I captured with the help of my good friend /u/ajamesmccarthy, who *does* focus on our lunar companion. 

In this image, the lit side was an 80 panel mosaic captured by me, and the dark side was a stack of 5300 frames from u/ajamesmccarthy, who painstakingly blended everything together to bring you this composite of our images.

[removed]
---------
I don't know why, but every time a high resolution photo is posted of outer space I get legitimately creeped out. It's SO FAR AWAY yet here I am on a handheld supercomputer zooming in to see every crater and scar.
---------
You know, I keep thinking a moon pic is a moon pic and you and Andrew keep blowing me away with incredible images like this time and again. Fantastic image fellas!
---------
Thanks for this awesome picture, u/idontlikecock
---------
Maybe it’s the weed but this looks exactly like the moon in rim world I feel.
---------
Excellent work! Using this technique, could one capture images or shadows of the man-made equipment we've left there?
---------
I'm not sure what's more breathtaking, the blue/brown contrast or in the top left, or the impact textures on the right
---------
Why is the moon brown? Has it not been cleaned in a while?
---------
Is it weird that this is kind of frightening to me for some reason? Great pic though!
---------
I always find if difficult to comprehend how large those craters really are.
---------
Is that an atmosphere on the moon or is it just an optical illusion?
---------
Thank you for this gorgeous photo u/idontlikecock
---------
This is awesome! Keep up the good work looks like I found a new background
---------
Please please please make this 3440x1440. I'll pay you $1
---------
for scale does anyone know roughly how big one of those craters are on average?
---------
Recently watched the Apollo 11 doc on Netflix, and it stuck in my brain when one of the astronauts remarked on how the moon looked brown, as opposed to the grey we normally would imagine! That’s exactly what entered my thought when I saw this photo. Just wow!
---------
Any chance they have this in some 16:9 aspect ratio?  I think this would make an amazing wallpaper
---------
Can you make another project from the southern hemisphere
---------
Swear this is the Destiny 2 cover? Sick pic though
---------
The other planets and moons would like your card.
---------
Awesome ! What do you use to photograph the moon ?
---------
Go to a totally dark room.

Set your brightness to 1/4.

Allow the moon to be the only thing on screen and hold it at arm length away!
---------
The moon is fake, OP works for NASA, and also does like cock.
---------
I need a higher resolution screen to properly enjoy this.
---------
Not trying to sound like an idiot, could someone tell me what all the circles on the surface are from?
---------
Incredible shot. Thank you for all the hard work that went to capturing this image, Absolutely bind blowing.
---------
Soooo dam good!!!! Well done and please do more!
---------
This is beautiful. Thanks for this in such crazy times.
---------
This is a work of art. Congratulations on your achievement.
---------
wow amazing, had no idea the moon had such spectrum of color!
---------
Beautiful pic bro, I never thought the moon was so colourful
---------
Thank you moon for taking so many hits for us. Truly a wonderful companion.
---------
Even after all these years of learning about how the United States landed on the moon ever since say Kindergarten, it has failed to stop amazing me.
---------
My mother is an real photography enthusiast.  Shared this with her.  She loved it like crazy.  Then pointed out OP’s username... ohhhh I’m still laughing at how I didn’t catch that.
---------
I did not know the moon had any color other then Gray-ish White. Thank you
---------
Reddit: the only place someone named “idontlikecock” can post amazing photos of the surface of our moon and contribute to science and learning at a high level
---------
Cosmic background? A legend! 
Beautiful photo 🤩
---------
This is really neat! Beautiful work! I enjoyed zooming in and looking around.
---------
Never realized the moon was so colorful.  Always assumed a white/grey rock.
---------
Congratulations... It is now my desktop background. Now I can enjoy it every time I minimize. Thanks!  


Not to blow things out of proportion, but that is one of the highest honor little old me can bestow. I shall be staring at it in all it's 4k glory on my new TV/monitor.
---------
Damn absolutely stunning!   You hit it out of the park with that picture
---------
Hey, I'm interested in doing this as a hobby. Do you mind telling me how you personally got started?
---------
Wow this is amazing. Great work to both of you!
---------
Poor moon has taken quite a beating for the last few billion of years. Look how scarred its surface is.
---------
Absolutely gorgeous!!!! Thank you so much for oosting!!!!
---------
Even though the moon’s atmosphere is incredibly thin, you can still see it in this beautiful shot. Great job!
---------
Never expected the moon to be orange or rusty
---------
Woooooo baby!!! This is absolutely beautiful, well done to all involved!!
---------
Amazing pic.  I can actually tell the most recent impact zones simply based on the direction of impact debris!
---------
Amazing picture! What’s the resolution on this?
---------
I just can’t get over how incredible it is that the moon’s rotation & revolutions are so perfectly synced that all of history we’ve had the exact same view.  

The more i think of it the harder it is to believe.
---------
This is really cool. Thanks for sharing. After seeing this, I feel silly thinking that the moon’s surface was all the same color since I had such a good view of it from a quarter million miles away. That said, this is the first picture I’ve seen that had traces of red. Is that due to iron?
---------
I just screenshotted TF outta this post. This is STUNNING!! And now I have fantastic, new wallpaper!!
---------
Those details. Beauty. Camera set-up? Can’t wait to show my son this!
---------
Gorgeous shot. I wish there was more of the background so I could see the moon’s glow fade into space.
---------
Is this 4K? Would make an amazing poster blown up to ~150cm x 150cm for a wall
---------
I thought a moon shot was where you stand five feet back and blow all over your partner's butt.
---------
Love the colour of it. Gorgeous pic. Well done dudes.
---------
The lines are so crisp looking at it is making me nervous
---------
Are you shitting me? This is best picture of the moon I have ever seen. Astronomical
---------
Y'know, I've been looking for a decent photo of the moon. I've been considering playing Legend of Dragoon, which is still one of my favorite RPG games to this day. In the game, there's a celestial body called The Moon That Never Sets, and it *usually* glows blue. But this is an old PS1 RPG, so very little of the surviving art from the game is in high-resolution or reasonably usable. So I'm thinking of creating my own wallpaper using The Moon That Never Sets as the focal point. If you haven't played the game, I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs.


All that said, are you alright with me using this photo for a heavily-edited, high-resolution version of [this still taken from the game](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/legendofdragoon/images/d/d5/MoonThatNeverSets.jpg)? It won't be for any type of commercial use, and I'll very likely re-up it once it's finished.
---------
hey!  it's that place where all the aliens live, and from whence they control the affairs of earth!  hail our tiny grey masters!!
---------
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever laid eyes upon.
---------
This the best photo of the moon I have ever seen and ever will see.
---------
Just wow. I had the pleasure of using a $100,000 telescope when i was at a community college and i had never seen the moon in such detail. This is how it looked. Just wow
---------
Is it me or does the Black Omen from Chrono Trigger look like it's on the moon?
---------
I feel like I often see pictures of the moon around this size. Knowing that the moon is smaller than earth, would it be possible to see astronauts on the moon from this distance? Or am I wrong in thinking we’re that “zoomed in” on the moon when I see images at this distance? How big is the biggest crater we can easily see from this image? Is it miles and miles big or just a couple? I guess that would help answer my question as far as scale goes...
---------
Its...kind of odd because it seems too reallistic almost like its concept art for a movie or video game rather than an actual picture.

I don't think I've ever seen any pictures of the moon showing such variation in the colors of its soil.
---------
Beautiful! Well done. Thank you fellow redditors for sharing your mastery
---------
Much different than my view.  Fucking amazing
---------
How do these many moon shots keep getting better and better? I have a folder full of moon photos! Time to add another to the bunch, great work guys, best one yet.
---------
This picture is insane! I love how you can zoom in and even make out a few faint galaxies.
---------
Are all those craters created from impacts? If so is the moon a body guard for us?
---------
I so enjoyed this image. It's incredible.  Thanks for sharing with us.
---------
You have to start hiding little aliens in your photos. 
“It’s probably just a smuge on the lens morty.”
---------
a username like that really shows how long you’ve been on this here reddit. beautiful stuff.
---------
Can I use this as my phone's wallpaper? It looks astounding to me!
---------
This is a dumb question but does the moon actually have that blue spot?
---------
Could we zoom in on where we landed on the moon?
---------
I'm pretty sure those "craters" are previous mining operations from a civilization of beings either lost through history or out of sight.  Juuuuust sayin......
---------
What an amazing image!  The detail level is tremendous.  Are those colors representative of the way it would actually look under the right lighting conditions?
---------
This looks so much like the world of r/rimworld
---------
That photo is just insane. Thanks for sharing, amazing!
---------
Why are there so many visible craters on the Moon but not on Earth?
---------
Absolutely incredible.  And great perspective of the bigger picture in these times.

Brilliant
---------
Man that thing has been peppered with meteors.  Pretty crazy.
---------
What's that blue stuff? That was never there before...

Whose been fuckin with the moon?
---------
It’s beautiful. Congratulations. I really, really, like this image.
---------
Weak! My iphone xxx can do that. Just joking. Love it! May we all get to enjoy it together after Corona.
---------
Bravo! Post saved. Ill show it to my 1st grader hes going to love it.
---------
Those surface craters look so tiny on the image, but must be huge if you were stood next to them.
---------
Awesome picture, seriously. Is there anyway to make this picture as a wallpaper in iPhone resolution? This would be nice to show to others
---------
Beautiful. I want a better printer...

Why is there a haze around the edges? At first I thought that may be it was the atmosphere, but I seem to recall being told that the moon doesn't have one. Is it just some light bleeding out a bit due to the optics or distortion from travel through our atmosphere?
---------
I'm getting so my joy from looking at it, and I dunno how do I share this with people, which is giving me stress lol.
---------
I knew exactly who the “fellow redditor” was as soon as I saw the photo...
---------
It might be the first time I’ve seen the moon in color. Why did I always think it had no color?
---------
As a scale reference, could someone put ohio on the moon?
---------
Hey, I think I can see Vector still chilling on the moon.
---------
What’s the best under 1k telescope for beginners? I’d love to get into the hobby
---------
I am actually dumbfounded that the moon has color and isnt just white..
---------
Damn. This is absolutely stunning. Our planet/view is beautiful.
---------
Hey, I didn’t say you could take such a high resolution picture of my face!
---------
how long did it take to edit out all the moon bases and aliens?
---------
This is freaking awesome.  So I gave you like 5 awards. vOv
---------
just imagine what you could do if you teamed up with a third redditor!
---------
Amazing picture, shame about the ultra-heavy banding though (reddit compresses the image?)
---------
Every time I see a high quality picture of the Moon, I always assume the Moon is just a giant satellite created by the government. Then I realize this is crazy and just admire how beautiful it is! Gorgeous!
---------
I don’t know much about the moon. Can some explain to me why there is blue stuff on it?
---------
That is simply fascinating! I don't have any coins, but, if I had, I would certainly spend them giving you a award.
---------
Will someone please make a Where’s Waldo out of this?
---------
Can anyone show where the moon landing occurred? Curious to see where on the map it is. Thanks.

It's a miracle that he even lived to 76, considering his condition. That's pretty close to an average lifespan -- very significant for someone with a disease that typically has a 5-year life expectancy. 
---------
Damn, what a shame. It was a miracle that he lived to be 76 and I hope those years were full of happiness and meaning. 
---------
To be fair, although this is horrible news, 76 is a great age for someone with as many medical conditions he had.
---------
> We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.

You really were special, Mr. Hawking. Rest in peace.
---------
He died on pi day which is also Einstein's birthday. If there is any day he could have died, this was the best day. 
---------
"I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first."

---------
He was truly an amazing human. His mind will be greatly missed 
---------
Rest in peace to a wonderful man. Thank you for everything, Stephen. 
---------
It is sad but we should just be happy that he lasted as long as he did, given the condition of his health. The worst part is that he didn't live long enough to get his Nobel Prize for Hawking Radiation.
---------
Dr. Hawkings showed that nothing, not even black holes last forever. I think his contributions to science may be an exception. This should be a day of mourning 
---------

---------
I feel like I’ve been gut punched. 
---------
We've lost one of the most intelligent human beings to have ever lived on the face of the planet. Thank you, sir, for what you have and will provide for the scientific community, the better of society, technological leaps, space travel, our comprehension of the big, beautiful, yet frightening place we live, and what your incredible ideas and their inevitable discoveries will give me, my children, and the rest of humanity. 
---------
At least we probably won't have to read any more of [his questionable pronouncements](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/stephen-hawking-interview-alien-life-climate-change-donald-trump) in response to weirdo questions about AI and whatever else that is out of his area of expertise. 
---------
The world feels like a dimmer place tonight.
---------
His [last](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qj74uXkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) published work was a children's book that he wrote with his daughter. That's a pretty nice one to end on. 
---------
If there is a afterlife, I hope he now knows all the answers. 
---------
R.I.P. Dr. Hawking. A Brief History of Time was the first science book I purchased with my own money as a kid and it completely blew my mind. Thank you for your contribution to our world.
---------
How the hell did he last this long with ALS? Son of a bitch was a fighter.
---------
I'd like to think he found it satisfying in some way to leave the world on Albert Einstein's birthday/Pi Day.
---------
I did not expect this today. But he defied odds and was one of the most brilliant minds in modern history. RIP 
---------
What a remarkable man with a remarkable Legacy.
---------
A huge portion of my love of astronomy and my career can be attributed to reading a Brief History of Time when I was younger. Mr Hawking has done so much more than discover, he empowered others to continue discovering.
---------
>One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.

Rest in peace, Mr Hawking, and thank you for everything.
---------
Wow, it’s really hard to frame this from a historical perspective and not just in like a celebrity perspective ya know?  This is way bigger than like Steve Martin dying.  This is one of the greatest minds the human race has ever had.
---------
"Life would be tragic if it weren't funny."

RIP to a great man
---------
A sad day for mankind.
---------
It feels surreal, I kind of felt he was going to live forever.
---------
[removed]
---------
He was such an inspiration to generations of men and women. We can only hope to have another one of him in our time.
---------
The Twentieth Century is dying one hero at a time.

RIP
---------
One of humanity's brightest.
---------
Rest in peace. May you walk again happily. 
---------
He will be dearly missed by the world. 6 years ago I read his book, “The Universe in a Nutshell”, on my morning bus ride to work, and it inspired me to pursue a greater truth in science. What an amazing man and outstanding legacy. Rest In Peace. 
---------
He updated a paper on arxiv only last week: “a smooth exit from cosmic inflation”.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07702
---------
Thank you for your contributions and inspirations to the human race good sir.
---------
Pretty tragic. I am choosing to think about it as though we were blessed with many more years of his brilliance than anyone could have expected due to his illness. He was a pargon of scientific integrity. He was my hero.
---------
Rest in peace
---------
Rip brother. I don’t believe in anything after death, but I sincerely hope that in life he took solace in the fact that is one of the most impactful human beings in the realm of science, and really showed that people labeled disabled can go above and beyond what most normal men couldn’t dream of.
---------
Astronomer here- I find it very important to note that Hawking was a very rare breed because unlike many others, he legit earned the fame surrounding him. The guy was brilliant, with theories that have spurned a ton of new research, *and* was an amazing person for overcoming his disabilities. I cannot think of his equal. 

It’s a sad day for physics.
---------
One of the greatest minds of our time and a true inspiration 
---------
RIP to a legend “those who live in the shadow of death are often those who live most” you will be missed.
---------
Wow. I didn't think I'd be so utterly crushed by his death. I'm so grateful he lived so long and shared his intellect with the world. 
---------
>He once said, ‘It would not be much of a universe if it wasn’t home to the people you love.’ We will miss him for ever.”

Thanks for being part of the universe, Steven.
---------
Dang, this hit me pretty hard. Feel lucky to have shared the world with him while he was around. I'm sure he will be remembered as one of the greats.
---------
What a true inspiration to people everywhere with a profound effect on so many, especially those in tough situations. He will truly be missed, but his impact on the world will not be forgotten. Rest in Peace, Dr. Hawking.
---------
A great inspirational legend in the field of science, his name alone has caused many young brilliant minds to push science to where we stand today. May his mind finally be freed from his cage of a body.
---------
Amazing what you can do when you have the ambition. RIP 😢
---------
"I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first." -- Stephen Hawking
---------
Wow, what an influential guy. He's gonna be remembered hundreds, thousands of years from now
---------
This just made my heart sink. I can't believe this happened. He is truly an amazing man. Around college he was told he had about a year to live and yet he lived untill 76 to change to world for the better. This man has inspired me greatly!
Rest In Peace Steven Hawking.
---------
RIP.  76 is a good run.

Everyones existence changes the world slightly, but few have far reaching implications for good.  You were a noted member of the latter.







---------
Dude was told he had 2 years to live every day... For 50 years.


---------
I love that he has an action figure of himself from The Simpson’s on his desk.
---------
The end of an era.
---------
Today we lost one of the good ones. 
---------
Oh shit, definitely wasn't expecting this. Sad day
---------
Out of interest, what did he contribute to science? I don't mean this derogatorily.  For example, Einstein contributed the General Theory, the Special Theory, E=MC^2, theorised about lightspeed and the limits of universal constants, predicted gravity waves, etc...  But I can't name one of Hawkings. Anyone?
---------
He will be missed.
---------
Oh come on, the least you could do was to get his name right.
---------
Jeez. 2018's first victim. Rest in peace Hawking. 
---------
An absolute groundbreaking legend whose legacy will live forever, RIP.
---------
I read this, and experienced my first real 'gasp'. I was truly in love with this man's mind. What an incredible human being.


---------
One part of his journey is over. Here's to the beginning of whatever comes next.

---------
This is kind of surreal.  RIP, doc.  Fucking legend.

Anyone else noticed this Great Man passed away on Albert Einstein's birthday and is the same age as when he passed away?
---------
In such a rush to got karma credits off his death that you can’t even spell the mans name correctly?
---------
Rip should've launched him in the Tesla great way to go out.
---------
Jesus fucking christ, I have no idea how to feel about this
---------
I just realized something: he died on pi day.
3.14159265359 march 14th

---------
I never knew much about him but I'll always love the Dexter episode based on him. 
---------
[Hawking radiation](https://youtube.com/watch?v=S6srN4idq1E)
---------
I think about the amount of people he influenced to become whatever they wanted as he overcame the diagnosis and that is staggering. Science or not he was an inspiration to humankind with his determination to not be defined by his illness.
---------
I suppose it's too late to tell him I didn't show up at his party because I hate to be the first guest.


...or is it?
---------
Easily on the Mount Rushmore of popular scientists.
---------
Just like that, the world feels so much emptier.
---------
While I agree it is impressive that he lived so long after his diagnosis, I believe it belittles his achievements to focus on his survival to the age of 76.  This man has contributed so much to our understanding of the universe we live in that his survival pales in comparison to the knowledge we have gained from his pursuit of understanding the world around him.  RIP you generous genius.
---------
So tragic and so epic. He died on March 14. 3-14. The Professor is winking at us. 
---------
This guy was my hero. Has been for as long as I remember. Started when I was around 8 years old and now I'm 16. Last year for our history class we had to write a speech about a person who we considered to be "great". I wrote mine about Stephen Hawking. This is what I wrote:

Imagine space. All the unknown. All the darkness. All still yet to find. We have yet only observed a predicted 4% of what is in our universe, so a question may come to mind: Who is helping us make sense of it all? The answer of course is astronomers, physicists, cosmologists and many more careers in science, but perhaps one of the most monumental and incredible theoretical physicist’s of all time is, Professor Stephen Hawking. Stephen Hawking is a man currently 74 years old and is still working hard to help answer the question of making sense of the universe. To understand why he is great, we must go back to his past. 
Stephen Hawking graduated from Cambridge and Oxford, two very famous current universities. Getting straight to the topic, for one, Stephen Hawking was confirmed to have ALS. A paralyzation disorder which is very deadly and still exists today (for those of you who don’t know what it is, it was the subject for the ice bucket challenge). In short, Stephen Hawking was predicted to live only three or four more years, however this is clearly wrong considering he is 74. This means he has already lived at least 17 times longer than predicted, which is already incredible in itself. A great quote from Stephen Hawking, “However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at”, and this is definitely applicable to Hawking. He has ALS, is paralyzed, and requires a chair to move, eat and speak. Despite this, he is still a major success in science. Likely Stephen Hawking’s most famous work, “A Brief History of Time”, was written using his chair. He was not able to physically type it so it took him roughly 4 years to write. This book covered many original ideas of the universe, theories on black holes, wormholes and lots more. Not only this, but some more titles written by the professor are (as already mentioned) a brief history of time (1988), black holes and baby universes (1993), one of my personal favourites the universe in a nutshell (2001), a briefer history of time (2005), the grand design (2010) and finally (most recently as well) my brief history (2013). These are a few of 107 books written by a paralyzed man in a wheelchair. Most all of these titles have fascinating theories and are filled to the brim with information.
Another reason for greatness is to have a long lasting impact, which Stephen Hawking definitely has. First off and quite obviously, he has had numerous impacts on science and the development of theories and creation of theories on black holes, wormholes, light and many others. This is quite easy to list as it is after all his profession, however, going into some of the deeper impacts by Stephen Hawking, he is has been an excellent role model for people with ALS. People with ALS can look to Stephen Hawking and see that despite their disease and immobility, there is still incredible things that can be done. It also gives hope to people as they see that Stephen Hawking with his disease has lived an incredibly long time, but most of all, he is a role model. Despite all that has been said, Stephen Hawking is straight up an excellent example. He fights a life threatening disease and still manages to be one of the most incredible scientists of all time. At the very least, I can say he is by far the most inspirational role model that I have.
Overall, I believe we all can quite confidently say that Stephen Hawking is a great man. He has impacts, has made theories and is an excellent example for people all around the world. He has been fighting a disease for decades and has come out victorious. He has changed the way people look at the universe and its foundations. Stephen Hawking once said, “Life would be tragic if it weren’t funny”, so I give you this. Stephen Hawking is a great man due to his impacts, his breakthroughs, his willpower, his theories, his story, his beginnings, and of course, his space chair. 
Thank you~

---------
I am currently studying Physics. He inspired me a lot. Hope I can complete his legacy someday.
---------
RIP. If only he could live to see the JWST go up
---------
The guy didn't even look 76. Not saying this to be insensitive, but I wonder if not being able to move your face for this long reduces wrinkles forming.
---------
RIP, what an intelligent man. I hope he gets to watch us from "the other side" and see if his predictions come to pass!
---------
Rest in peace, O Significant scientist of 20th century.
---------
Rest in Phenomenology my friend, you'll be missed.
---------
Wow. Im stunned and sad and happy he made it this long all at the same time.

RIP Dr. Hawking, your legacy will survive as long as humans do.
---------
I hope he was content and lived fully his life . His works will be the basis for the future.
---------
As someone who is recently getting into the universe beyond earth, this is super depressing. May he rest in peace.
---------
He is now where he always wanted to be.....one with the universe.
---------
Rest in peace captain, may you journey to the stars and beyond
---------
A truly inspiring man. A true giant amongst the rest of humanity. 
---------
He was given two years to live when he was initially diagnosed with a motor neurone disease in the 60s but he outlived his life expectancy by nearly fifty years. In that time, he became one of the most iconic and accomplished scientists of all time. He lived an incredible life and he will definitely be missed.
---------
This is such a sad news for the scientific world. Considering the fact how smart he was, I only hope that the people he was working with were able to grasp as much ideas and knowledge from this genius. 

No matter the condition he was in he was able to have a good life and great people that supported him. Moreover, the respect that he got was earned through hard work and dedication. 

I can add this that he was able to raise awareness  for the disabled people as well. No matter the disability you can achieve great things when your hard work and dedication is set for them. 

RIP Genius. 
---------
Can a mod edit the title to spell Stephen's name correctly?
---------
He did so much with so many limitations. I wonder what could have been ever more if he didn't have to overcome so much. Maybe though that is one of the reasons he was o remarkable. 
---------
So stunned this happened. Definitely took me by surprise. RIP for sure. 
---------
Rest in peace, Mr. Hawking, from myself and from Humanity.
---------
Damn it, he still had so much to give us.

This is rough.
---------
Havnt felt this awful since the day Steve Irwin died, one of my childhood hero’s has died 
---------
Stephen Hawking dies on Pi day.. what a coincidence.
---------
Wow.. One of my favorite things he was in was this scene in tng

https://youtu.be/nEa7CfPaCRw
---------
What a sad news. Thank you for contributing and inspiring the world.
---------
I'm sad he's gone, but I'm thankful for all he was able to provide to humanity. 
---------
Thank you for your insight and advancing the scientific community in astounding ways. The world mourns your leaving us, but celebrates you! May you now understand all the things we do not. Rest in peace you amazing, crazy old coot, you! You’ll be sorely missed. 
---------
The world has lost one of the greatest minds of all time. RIP master of the free mind.
---------
So, do we have a DNA sample that can be used for cloning? I want to collect the DNA of many super-geniuses and create clone children to bring up as a happy weird family. But not until I'm 333 years old or so.
---------
Goddamn this has hit me hard. The world was so lucky to have a mind such as Mr. Hawking's, and even luckier to have it for as long as we did. I never met Stephen but his absence already makes the world seem dimmer. Rest in peace you beautiful man.
---------
I was not expecting this today. 

What a mind and an inspiration to the world. I hope that wherever he is, he is at rest. 
---------
Gone is a great mind at a time when the world needs it most.
---------
Steven Hawking had THE will to live. It's remarkable that he pushed on this long and had a chance over these last 50 years to share his discoveries with us. To which we are all beyond thankful!
---------
RIP TO THE GOAT. Does anyone else’s think the universe taking him on Pi day is fitting? Happy March 14th :)
---------
Did he die on Pi Day (3.14)?  Infinite number for an infinite man. 
---------
He was given twenty-something years to live. He looked at death in the face and took 50 or so more, then proceeded to gift humanity with new levels of understanding of the cosmos, all while inspiring so many people to pursue science, among which I'm included. If that's not the definition of an incredible life, I don't know what that is.

I'm not sad. I'm grateful to have lived at the same time as him.
---------
RIP Stephen Hawking, the man who made me love science
---------
Man...the world just doesn't feel the same without Hawking around.
---------
Perfect reason to not always blindly believe what your told and take it as fact. 

He lived longer than some people with no medical issues but was told he never would.


Edit: r.i.p.
---------
On PIE day none the less. 3.14. R.I.P. you incredible bastard 
---------
I'm proud to have lived in the same time as Hawking. I'm honored. I'm sad, but hopeful that more brilliant minds will pick up where he left off. 
---------
The world is a less magical place without him in it
---------
I feel like we just lost our key to the universe or something. He had such an awesome mind ☹️ 
---------
Stephen Hawking was one of those people who you could never imagine actually dying. 
---------
It's a little surreal to realize the greatest mind of our generation has passed. Rest in peace Stephen Hawkins, humanity will miss you. 
---------
Link to his AMA a couple of years ago for those of us reminiscing: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers
---------
damn, what a man we’ve lost. this dude has been through some shit, and yet he still managed to accomplish so much. the man was born exactly 300 years after Galileo’s death, there ain’t no way that’s just a coincidence. he was diagnosed with ALS at 21 and was given a life expectancy of 2 years; he got a 55 year bonus.

look at what he’s done: he designed his own fucking wheelchair, he discovered Hawking radiation - meaning that black holes emit radiation, that there’s no end to the universe and that it’s constantly expanding, and he did this all while his body was slowly paralyzing him. this guy is a beast. 

RIP Prof. Hawking. he will be missed. 
---------
Part of me wants me to believe this isn't true, the other half wants to believe he passed away a minute to 2. If so, he would've died at 3/14 1:59.
---------
A fitting tribute would be for him to be interred at Westminster Abbey, alongside Sir Isaac Newton.

---------
I know this comment is just going to be buried, but I think it’s of note that Hawking died on Einsteins birthday, who also lived to be 76. Today is also Pi Day. (3.14)
---------
“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet” - will do professor 👍🏻✨🔭 
---------
  -  Stephen Hawking’s 3 favorite songs.


“[Symphony Of Psalms](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DqWZGUO_eoc) was in fact the first piece of music Professor Hawking ever purchased. “I first became aware of classical music when I was 15,” he said. “LPs had recently appeared in Britain. I ripped out the mechanism of our old wind-up gramophone and put in a turntable and a three-valve amplifier. I made a speaker cabinet from an old book case, with a sheet of chip-board on the front. The whole system looked pretty crude, but it didn’t sound too bad. At the time LPs were very expensive so I couldn’t afford any of them on a schoolboy budget. But I bought Stravinsky’s Symphony Of Psalms because it was on sale as a 10” LP, which were being phased out. The record was rather scratched, but I fell in love with the third movement, which makes up more than half the symphony.”


[Wieniawski’s Violin Concerto No. 1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aNOdaBJbT8A)Professor Hawking was actually inspired to buy a collection of Wieniawski’s music after hearing his second concerto on Radio 3 in the 1990s, but prefers the first in particular for its “haunting phrase in the first movement”.


[Francis Poulenc’s Gloria](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ReqsEqKtyyA) is the final piece in Professor Hawking’s musical trilogy. Part of the work caused a “scandal” – in the French composer’s own words – when it was first performed in 1959 because of its unusual mixture of light-heartedness and spirituality. Poulenc later explained that he had been thinking of frescoes in which angels stick out their tongues and “serious Benedictines whom I saw playing soccer one day” when he wrote it.
Professor Hawking first heard the Poulenc Gloria in Aspen, Colorado, during the resort’s 1995 music festival. “You can sit in your office in the physics centre there and hear the music without ever buying a ticket,” he said. “But on this occasion I was actually in the tent to hear the Gloria. It is one of a small number of works I consider great music.”

---------
54 years with ALS is not bad considering the average person who gets it passes after 5.
---------
Holy shit. Of all "celebrities" to pass in recent years, this one made my chest sink.. RIP Stephen..
---------
He came from the universe, he discovered the universe and now he returns back to the universe. He will forever be remembered by mankind.
“I am the sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been seen done, of everything done-to-me. I am everyone everything whose being-in-the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens after I'm gone which would not have happened if I had not come.” - Salman Rushdie
---------
It was Stephen who inspired me to begin studying physics and computer science. I remember when I was three I watched him debate with Carl Sagan, and I remember wanting to do what they do. Thanks for putting me on the right path. Rest in peace.
---------
I really wish I could've met him in person. He was a visionary, a great intellectual. His book "A Brief History Of Time" was the first book that sparked my interest in relativity and quantum mechanics. RIP Mr. Hawking, you shall be remembered forever.
---------
I think I may have killed him. I looked him up yesterday and was surprised he was still alive and said he could not have much time left. 
---------
He was such an inspiration to me, not only as a person, but also a physicist and as a great science communicator. I read A Brief History of Time while in secondary school and it is probably the reason I'm pursuing a PhD in Astrophysics today. I mean, sure, I always loved science and was no doubt going to become a scientist no matter what, but the way the science subject are taught in school, Physics was boring. I did it because I loved science and maths, not because I cared that much about physics. But reading his book inspired me so much, it showed me what physics could, what current physics research was really about, what the big questions they're still asking are. I didn't know what physics in college could be, to me it was just stuff like dropping a rock in the water and measuring the displacement so I could calculate the volume and density of a rock. Not very exciting stuff. But reading Stephen Hawking talk about Black Holes blew my mind and since then I knew, screw biology I'm getting a degree in Astrophysics. And seven years later, here I am, still in University, looking to the stars, thanks to him.

---------
Wow, this stunned me. I have no other focus right now other than remembering his documentaries that I watched on repeat as a kid. I'm not all that spiritual but I think it was destined that he live such a long and joyful life. His contributions to our understanding of the universe are invaluable. An incredible mind and spirit of perserverance. Rest in Peace Dr. Hawking

I bet this blew your mind when you took the picture. It's one thing to see pics of the planets from NASA, but it's another thing when you take the picture yourself and it looks the same as the ones from NASA. 

Well at least I got that feeling looking at your picture. 
---------
Whats the little dot on the left side half way between jupiter and the egde of the image?
---------
Must have been pretty amazing for early astronomers to see planets for the first time, like this
---------
Very impressive improvement here, keep shooting for the stars.
---------
That blows my mind you can see Jupiter with this quality. Is the right image magnified?
---------
What model telescope are you using to get those kinds of pictures? I was thinking about getting one. 
---------
Did you have any equipment improvements, or is this all from improving technique? 
---------
Just practice or new equipment too? Seems like a hell of a jump for the first shot.
---------
What was the equipment and picture settings for each photo?
---------
[deleted]
---------
My buddy's dad is an expert on astrophotography and has taken some really amazing pictures. Check out his site: www.astropix.com
---------
I remember one time I tried to get a good picture of the moon and it turned out, well just like the picture on the left, and I go “well I guess it’s impossible with a regular camera” that’s insane, keep up the good work.
---------
Noob here, how does one get better at improving photography skills in this respect. Did you learn how to better stabilize your camera, or learn how to better utilize your current equipment? It seems like an improvement like this would only occur from an equipment upgrade
---------
Practice...and better equipment. Mostly better equipment.
---------
Is that the great storm in the bottom right centre?
---------
Just practice of the same techniques produced the increase in quality, or did you employ different equipment at all?
---------
What’s the moon that you can see as a tiny speck?
---------
Why was the first one so terrible and the last one so good? What exactly were you doing wrong that you learned how to fix through experience and what were the steps you took to correct those things?
---------
Brilliant pictures!

Is this 6 months later with the same kit? 
---------
[removed]
---------
By this time in two years you'll be taking family photos of Jupiter's residents.
---------
Can you guys recommend something not so expensive to take similar shots or just for observation 
---------
Cool. Im a little dumb with this, does one just point their camera into a telescope? Or is there special adaptors? 
---------
Beautiful. May I ask what that tiny dot on the left is on the right picture? A moon? Saturn in the distance? Or aliens?

I was kidding on the last one. Though seriously, what is that?
---------
Nice. How much more xp do you need to level up so you can take pictures of Saturn or Uranus? 
---------
What is your setup? Can I capture this detail with an 8” Dobson?
---------
This is really impressive and cool! Kinda wish I had the equipment to take these kinds of shots, but oh well. Keep up the good work! What other photos have you taken of outer space?
---------
Without using any additional lenses or magnification, I wonder how far you would have to physically move the telescope forward to double the size of Jupiter in the picture on the right.
---------
HOW. Can I get a tutorial? Equipment used? Can a poor college student with an itching for astronomy do this? 
---------
This really makes me want to get into this sort of thing.  I don't know anything about photography or practical astronomy, but I can kind of imagine the feeling of awe and satisfaction I would get if I were able to take a photo like this.  Great job OP, and you can know that people have been inspired by your photo.
---------
Hats off to your patience dear friend. Please keep doing same.
---------
Is that smaller dot next to Jupiter in your most recent picture one of Jupiter’s Moons, or perhaps another planet further out? Do you know?
---------
Looks like you just bought a nicer scope though.
---------
The right picture is so clear that I can almost form a new community around #thejupiterisflat
---------
What equipment did you use if you dont mind me asking? Great inprovement keep up the good work!
---------
I feel like when I look at the left, then the right. The left one pulses. 
---------
Looks great. Have you seen any ufo's? Pm details if you have 
---------
wow, great picture. Look at the Red Spot... it's kind of scary, like a great eye  looking right back at you
---------
It's so weird to me that other planets are real. I sometimes can't wrap my mind around space and other planets. Very cool picture! 
---------
How do you get a picture like this? Cam you tell us what equipment you use and your process?
---------
How do you practice? 
---------
The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy has this to say about space.  Space,” it says, “is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist’s, but that’s just peanuts to space.”
---------
It sucks that we a stuck in the generation that knows sooo much but two generations from now, we will know sooo little...

We are in a grasping reach of legit space travel, but everyone reading this, on this date I made this post, will be dead before it's a reality.😔
---------
What model telescope are you using to get those kinds of pictures? I was thinking about getting one.
---------
I'm always amazed when I see planets captured like this. It looks so fake, but you know it's out there.
---------
The amount of times Jupiter has saved Earth from asteroids is mind blowing. It's almost like we have our own cosmic bodyguard.
---------
Step 1: Buy a better camera / a SLR with the right lens

Step 2: Get better photo

Of course it will be better than the smartphone picture
---------
Wonderful improvement. Just one question: what’s the little dot off to the left of Jupiter? A Galilean moon?
---------
Amateur astronomy is amazing isn't it?  The first time I saw Saturn's rings through my scope I seriously nearly cried. Absolutely thrilling stuff. Your Jupiter pic is stunning. 
---------
If only we had a clear image. Hold on a sec. Zoom in on that dot. Ok, now enhance the image. Sharpen using the super-chip processor. 

*puts on shades*

Johnson, I think we got 'em.
---------
Hey OP, I remember you posting this [same photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/526mb1/the_picture_on_the_left_is_my_first_image_of/) to /r/astrophotography a little over a year ago. Have you not made any improvements since? If you come on back we'd be more than happy to help you find ways to improve your image :) 
---------
Why don't we ever see the back side of Jupiter??????????????????
---------
Ones with a I phone one is with professional equipment 
---------
Damn that is impressive, good job!  Just a seriously remarkable degree of skill growth over such a short span of time. 
---------
Does anyone else find the immense emptiness in space kind of scary?
---------
I literally said 'that's not real' out loud to myself as I saw this, then read the comments and holy shit. Nice fucking shot. 

My wolf plushie that sleeps in my bed every night is called Jupiter because after my mom bought him for me at a zoo when I was younger, I took him to the space exhibiton right outside the shop and we looked at planets and I called him Jupiter because that was the biggest and coolest planet.
---------
Late to this, but great work OP. Absolutely stunning. I remember when I first saw Jupiter with my own eyes through a telescope. I was just stunned. I didn't realise it moved so fast either!
---------
6 months of practice can be translated to "I bought better equipment".
---------
Hey, how do.you improve pictures of  a planet. Doesnt it just depend on the camera? Sorry for my ignorance but i have 0 idea about photography
---------
Can I ask what the small dot to the left of Jupiter in the second photo is?
---------
That’s awesome! I just had a guest poster on my blog about astrophotography you might enjoy: [Astrophotography 101](http://korievansphotography.com/blog/astrophotography101) 
---------
What changes did happend over time. Did equipment change? What kind of optics did you use, telescope? What camera?
---------
What are the most important tips / tricks you've learned?
---------
Apologies if this has been asked-I’m in a rush and really don’t want forget to request help. I’ve been interested in learning to take nighttime photography for sometime now, because even my images of the super moon turn out bad. Can you please offer any advice on how to learn?Can I use my iPhone with the tripod, or do I need more specialized equipment? What pitfalls would you help me avoid as a beginner? Anything that you share, will help me immensely. I am extremely grateful for you even taking the time to read my comment. Thank you.
---------
"6 months of practice" = Thousands of dollars in credit card debt for better equipment.
---------
Some questions. How does one practice this? How did you take the pic? What camera? I'd love to know cuz I'd love to be able to do that but I'm afraid I know nothing about photographing celestial objects 
---------
I want to find it but all I have is a pair of Celestron binoculars.
---------
/u/Jfredolay  can you explain how you got these shots? I saw this post last night and it blew up so I hope you haven't already done so. What equipment did you use etc?
---------
As a kid I often used to point my flashlight at the Moon and flash it on/off in hopes of getting a reply.

[The speed of light between Earth and Mars in real time.](https://youtu.be/CSqFBbNtt9c)

There's this really cool scene in The Expanse where one of the protagonists on Earth has a video chat with her husband on the Moon and everything has a three second delay due zo travel time which did a really good job at examplifying this.
---------
[the entire solar system in 1 moon = 1 pixel (it is also capable of portraying light speed)](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html)

Pretty eye-opening how fast that is.

And it's still too slow for interstellar travel...
---------
How long would it take you to get to the moon driving a car going 70mph?

It's funny when you realize that - if we travel with speed of light, we will freely explore  our solar system and only the closest stars.

---------
When we colonise the moon they'll have to set up their own multiplayer game servers or deal with 3 second lag
---------
Since we have this, I feel it's worth adding a point of comparison to help highlight the sheer vastness of space.

Assuming optimal orbits (I.E. as close as possible), an identical light source will take **three minutes** to reach Mars. Yeah, *that's just Mars, on a perfect day.* It gets way longer the further out you go.
---------
Wow. Over 2 sec lag if you play games on the moon. Literally garbo place. Would  ever visit. 
---------
[removed]
---------
What’s cooler (I think) about this, is this is the speed of causality. Nothing is faster than light. So, if the moon were to disappear, we wouldn’t know it until we saw it a second later. No form of communication could beat it, no early warning system could radio it in. In fact, even gravity propagates at the speed of light, so the ocean tides wouldn’t be affected until it has time to reached us. 

This is the issue about simultaneity. Which happened first? The moon disappearing, or the moment we observed it? It feels like it happened in the past. But since it’s impossible to observe its exact occurrence until it reaches us, you could equally say it happened the moment you observed it.   Any observation you could do before it reaches you would be like looking into the future.

Would love to see more of these with other planets.

Speed of light is relatively slow (no pun intended) when you look at how vast the universe is. To do any real deep traveling, we would pretty much need worm holes unless there is some possible way to go "warp speed" or something
---------
I don't know why but this makes me feel uneasy

The crazy thing for me is that I’ve driven enough in the last 20 years to make it to the moon and back four times.

So how can Goku go so fast with instant transmission when all he does is convert himself to light?

I imagine that in the future, taking a warp drive ship from Earth to Luna Base will be like flying from Boston to JFK. Rich business people will do it because they can and then tell everyone it's more convenient, even though the plasma ionic drive Greyhound shuttle is only 35 bucks and gets you there in the same amount of time when you take security and prep time into account.

This is the most boring game of Pong I’ve ever seen. Is this Twitch?

After watching this, I wish there was something similar but it had the Sun as a starting point, then sending the light out to each individual planet. I feel that would be a cool visual.

Finally! I’ve had this link bookmarked for years and new it would come in hand one day.

This is a ‘tediously accurate’ map of the solar system.

You can scroll from the Sun to Pluto in real time and everything is completely to scale. You can also skip ahead and there’s a few jokes along he way. Great site really.
---------
So Earth and the Moon were the first Pong players?
---------
Ugghh I hate the lag while gaming on the moon
---------
This just puts “light year” into perspective. Like shit is so far away it would take millions of years, at a speed we can’t even attain, to reach stuff 
---------
I had a friend in high school who literally didnt believe in the speed of light. Dude yelled at me when I said something about the light from the sun we were seeing at that moment had in fact left the sun minutes ago.
---------
I think that the speed of light is so slow that we must be living in a holographic universe with strange rules. speed of light is way too slow.

Cant wait for that eclipse tonight. Its going to be EPIC!!!

Someone should do a version from the perspective of the lightbeam where you click it to travel and it immediately updates to the other position.

[To see all the shots I've taken in the year since the original image, come check out my instagram](https://instagram.com/cosmic_background/). I share the behind the scenes on these posts, so you can see what goes into making a super high-res image of the moon.

A year ago I shared [this 81 megapixel image of the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/arer0k/i_took_nearly_50000_images_of_the_night_sky_to/). The response was absolutely overwhelming. I was still a very amateur photographer when I took that picture, and I've learned a lot since then, so I took this picture last night while the moon was in a similar phase to attempt to show how my experience has allowed me to improve on these shots. [Here it is in full 400 megapixels.](https://www.easyzoom.com/imageaccess/4b77cb0a226949ac9f4b462b2fa87677)

This image was taken by using a telescope at 5000mm, and shooting a small section of the moon at a time. Each section was taken by recording a video of 2000 frames, and then stacking and sharpening each frame individually, then combining 70 tiles to create a mosaic of the lit side of the moon, which was then combined with multiple shots from another camera that captured color, stars, and earthshine. For more info about the equipment used to take this and other deep space images-[check out this video I made walking through it.](https://youtu.be/yycwtaLUOgI)
---------
You know its gonna be a good picture when you click on it and your computer freezes for 30s.
---------
What’s with the blue coloration in the center? 

Very impressive!
---------
May I ask how big is the raw file (file size) for this image alone? Awesome shot, btw.
---------
Oh my god. I can’t believe I exist in a time when I get to see this. This is insane.
---------
I actually have your original image as my lock screen background image.
---------
Me, opening up the full res version

Are you able to spot the Apollo landing site anywhere?

I could be totally wrong about the location, though
---------
20,000 x 20,000 pixels

A poster print at 300 dpi would be about 5.5 x 5.5 feet in size.

A poster print at 72 dpi would be about 23 x 23 feet in size.

A 24" 1080p monitor is about 92 dpi.

It would take a grid of 19 x 11 monitors at 1920x1080 to display every pixel of the photo 1:1. That's nineteen rows of eleven monitors side by side per row.

It would take a grid of 10 x 6 UHD TVs at 3840x2160 to display every pixel of the photo 1:1. That's ten rows of six UHD TV's side by side per row.

It would take a grid of 5 x 3 8K TVs at 7860x4320 to display every pixel of the photo 1:1. That's five rows of three 8K TV's side by side per row.
---------
This is amazing.  I've been doing astrophotography for a while, and I still don't know how to do Earthshine.
---------
This is beautiful. Any thoughts on the cause of the glow around the edges? Is it camera effects or levitating moon dust from static electricity? 

Also, what does a single image look like? Would be neat to see the comparison.

No testa this time huh? Your pics are awesome dude, keep up the good work!!

One small step for man, one giant leap for reddit users.
---------
It wouldn't surprise me if this photo makes it on the cover of a magazine or in an encyclopedia. 

Well done my friend, well done.
---------
I always “knew” that the moon wasn’t a perfect sphere but this detail is so amazing and made it look completely new to me.
---------
This is such a beautiful composite.  I'm very grateful for you taking the time to make it as well as post it.
---------
That is absolutely amazing. Fantastic job! The crater detail is *amazing*.
---------
The original is my laptop background. Thank you.
---------
Very sneaky of you photoshopping out all the secret moon bases OP, but you're not fooling anyone.
---------
Isn't it beautiful!--the image and the moon both--I love the fact that the moon is everyone's personal gemstone, set where it can be admired by you and you alone if you like; it's all yours, every speck of it-- and it's mine, my favorite possession, and it's everyone else's too.  If anyone tried to use (say) a laser to advertise on it, I would go mad with fury, and so would all the other moon-owners, and the device would be crushed by mobs.
---------
It really looks like the moon is floating.  Good stuff
---------
And I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon.
---------
Crazy to think what Earth’s surface would look like if it weren’t for our atmosphere that burns up incoming meteors.
---------
What are the lines that look like trails?  Old fissures?  There's one in the right side and another of the left under the darker maria.
---------
Your old version is one of the few things I've saved on reddit. It's helped me out through some dark times.

Space, specifically the moon, has always brought me a sense of tranquility when my life was turbulent. Having it in my pocket, courtesy of you and reddit, had been a saving grace. No matter how big my problems felt, they felt insignificant when I looked at the moon. 

Finding this picture tonight made me sure of it. Thank you, OP.
---------
This is the first picture of the moon I’ve seen where the shape looks irregular like how it actually is. Great job man.

One year ago I downloaded the picture and had it printed to hang above my bed.

Oh hey, I’m using your old version as my phone background right now. Can’t wait to use the new version!
---------
For some reason close up pictures of the moon give me the heebie-jeebies. First time I saw the moon through a telescope I noped right outta there!
---------
 How large is one of the little craters on there?
---------
I love it when you post your pictures, they have a depth and feel unlike any others I've seen.
---------
Wow!  I think this is the first pic I have seen where I can easily see and follow the imperfections in the visible horizon all the way around.  Seeing the rise and fall of the land.  Impressive work.
---------
Awesome work! Are those the actual stars from your images?
---------
Anyone know what caused the feature in the centre just above the shadow? Kind of looks like valley
---------
Awesome picture. For Christmas my girlfriend got me a 3D printed globe of the moon that lights up and I was able to find the matching parts. At least I think so...

You know I see these high res moon pictures a lot but I don’t think I could ever get tired of them. The moon is so beautiful.
---------
Out of curiosity would it be possible to see the lunar lander from apollo missions from telescopes
---------
Dude, your moon picture has been my background ever since! Thank you for the new and improved version! See you next year!
---------
Think you can ever get a photo is the flag of the moon landing?
---------
Could you theoretically see the flag that was placed in 1969 using images like these?
---------
This is beautiful, thanks. Can someone tell me why we can see the American Flag, on the moon?
---------
I still have the photo you posted last year as my phone background! Amazing to see the new version!
---------
This is amazing! Your original has been my phones wallpaper ever since I saw it uploaded, time to update!
---------
Definitely remember this photo. It was my background for almost all of the past year : )
---------
First photo I’ve ever seen of the moon that is so detailed it actually just looks like a big, round rock. Pretty fascinating. Not sure if I’m expressing correctly. Just amazing to see it so...right there.
---------
If a redditor took this picture, imagine the quality of the pictures NASA has of the moon, or other planets.
---------
I wish someone could like put a house in one of the small holes so I could have a idea of how bog or small they are
---------
Thank you for your work. It was so beautiful that I had a large print made at Walgreens and hung it in my sons room. We look at it together and talk about it most nights.
---------
I love these types of pictures, because the more you zoom the more you’ll see and it won’t be pixels. 

Thank you for the share mate, absolutely phenomenal.
---------
that's insane!!! ive only tried getting pictures of the moon only with my canon t5 camera which is not good but all i have lol but wow that's crazy! maybe i should invest in a telescope like that haha

Awesome! I'd pointed out something similar on another moon image, but on this one, the entire APOLLO 17 Landing site, with all it's landmarks, is visible on this picture!  [https://imgur.com/a/vVuiiiD](https://imgur.com/a/vVuiiiD)
---------
Cool thing about the image, has an impressive resolution 743 meters per pixel. (roughly half a mile for barbaric measure units ;) ).
---------
I wonder if you could get a picture so high resolution that you can zoom in and see where we've landed.
---------
Can I ask a really dumb question? With pictures this high in resolution, is it possiblt to see the moon landing site?
---------
Gonna save this as my wallpaper! It’s fucking beautiful
---------
Your 81 megapixel photo has been the background on my phone for a year.

Time to update it! 

Absolutely Love the photos. Keep it up!!
---------
At a high enough resolution can we see the Apollo landing site?
---------
2 questions...

1. What are the blue areas on the surface?

2. If you zoom right in, the edge, particularly the top right quarter doesn't look circular, more like it's a polygon in a computer game, i.e a lot of straight sides estimating (but definitely not) a circle. Is this just a consequence of the merging process? ... Or what's going on there?


Great pic by the way!
---------
That is absolutely amazing. Fantastic job! The crater detail is *amazing*.
---------
Woah...

is it possible to see the landing sites or are the pixels too long?
---------
Oh, b-but its fake tho. XxX_W4keUpSh33pl3_XxX says its a giant egg that reptilian politicians hatch from.


In all seriousness, this is beautiful. Its so well defined, I almost feel like I could touch it.

I see no nazi helium 3 refinery.

Ah right... They are on the other side.
---------
One observation... the horizon looks kind of not that round. Is that an artifact from composing all the images or is it really the ruggedness of the Moon’s surface? I referenced other photos from NASA and didn’t see such deformation around the edges.
---------
Can we stahp pls? It's like another one every week here
---------
Ok the pic is really nice and stuff but honestly how many times is this gonna be “edited/improved” and reposted
---------
How is this different from your post 13 days ago? It literally looks flipped with a couple minor adjustments. I guess some people really like fake internet points and awards
---------
Its amazing what greqt people we have on earth  keep up your good work :)
---------
I’m always excited to see this username. Amazing stuff.
---------
This imagen is amazing, and I love it! Keep up the good work!
---------
What is the haze around the bright side? An artifact? An effect caused by Earth atmosphere?
---------
It's crazy when you think about the fact that the moon is almost 400.000km away from us, yet you can create such a high res image of it. Amazing!
---------
So do you take a picture of each region then compose them together afterwards?
---------
Thanks for sharing this great shot, did you spot any surface anomalies ?
---------
I am amazed but also confused to the blue please someone explain

Damn that's amazing!

Question... How come the craters appear to always have the same depth? . Regardless of size they seem to flatten out at a point.

It looks weird to see the moon with this much detail.
---------
Picutres like this seriously blow my mind... just incredible.

I thought this was a destiny screenshot or something. Good job
---------
Your last photo has been my phone background since you posted it.
---------
I zoomed in a little on the center of the dark side, and I can see a faint face in some of the details. Killer man!
---------
Yoink - I'll be taking that to update my homescreen on my phone. Thank you!
---------
what, and i cannot stress this enough, the fuck. 



this is so amazing! i fuckin love space
---------
Amazing!

Also, amazing that we have the capability to take photos that clear. Bet we could take a photo of a person on the surface of the moon.
---------
Where’s that fucking cow everyone talked up when I was a kid?!
---------
The other one has been my phone background for a couple months now and I had totally forgotten how I came across it. Glad this updated version made it to my feed so I can follow and enjoy all your work. Amazing shots by the way!
---------
Is there any resources you have for the technical side of being able to do this kind of stuff. Been a photographer for around 10 years but I haven't gotten to do much astrophotography.
---------
How long does it take to capture 140,000 pictures?
---------
The first one is my background. I like it better
---------
Looks like one of those ever lasting jaw breakers from the candy store after a few days.
---------
I still have your first picture of the Moon as my desktop wallpaper.
---------
How do you take 140,000 pictures of the exact same angle? I get hundreds but that many seems absurd to me, who has no real experience in this.
---------
I really love your work because you live very close to me so whenever I go out and look at stuff through my telescope I find out a day later you took pictures of the same stuff. You are what got me into astrophotography and it's been a slow start but I'm very slowly getting the hang out it. Keep up the amazing work Andrew!
---------
Can someone explain to me what those blue fringed yellowish dots in the bottom right corner are. They all look the exact same and there are even some tiny ones way deep in the background. 

Incredible picture btw. I had no idea the moon had so many lines on it.
---------
Wow! I’ve been using your photo from last year as my phone background since I saw it. Guess it’s time for an upgrade!
---------
Thank you for putting so much effort into making my day.

This is amazing!!! What is that blue mark on the moon( at the top) almost looks like a bruise lol.
---------
Moon police here, "our" ain't right you gotta say "the".
---------
This is awesome--have you considered having your work printed and offered for sale?  I'm thinking of something like Displate that does those high-quality printed sheet metal posters.
---------
Your shots are always my phone wallpapers. Keep up the good work.
---------
For the last year, your initial image of the moon has been on my desktop at home.

 I am now going to update it.
---------
Simply and completely amazing.  Thank you for sharing!
---------
Sh\*t! My desktop resolution needs to be bigger. I love having extraordinary pictures of the moon to have on my desktop.   
Thanks for the picture. My lecture on Orbital Mechanics is Monday.
---------
You can even see where the atmosphere ends, wow
---------
That first picture is still the background on my phone
---------
Awesome! I have the picture from last year as my wallpaper still. Guess it's time for me to upgrade to this one!
---------
I feel like I'm getting closer to actually walking on the moon.
---------
Well now I know I've had the same phone background for a year
---------
kinda crazy to zoom in on the stars in the background and see quite a bit of them are actually galaxies (I assume they are anyway)
---------
Love your work man. You deserve every bit of recognition you have received.

I wonder how long it will take for the average person to be able to visit that rock. Looks beautiful. Not to mention the view from there.
---------
At the bottom of the blue patch, there’s a weird trail that appears to go over some mounds and stuff. What would that be caused from? Kinda looks like the path left being by a snowball when making a snowman...
---------
Thanks for the phone wallpaper for the last year!
---------
Im just an average joe, married with one kid, and this is greatest picture of the moon I've ever seen. Thank you.
---------
I fear this is a really dumb question but here goes

Why does our moon have so many craters compared to what we know of our earth?
---------
That was my desktop wallpaper back when I had a job, I love this pic thanks
---------
I'm curious as to why there are craters yet no asteroids.
---------
You must be *over the moon* to share this picture of the moon.
---------
Can I download so I can print? You can put watermark if you want I just really want to use it on my wall.
---------
And to think, it's all made of cheese.  Wow. Amazing.
---------
Hi! I know this will probably get buried in the comments but I've actually been using your last picture as my phone's background since I saw it! Guess it's time for an update and thank you very much for sharing!
---------
What's even more awesome about this picture is zooming in on the stars and planets in the background.  You can actually see the rings of Saturn.
---------
I love your moon pics. They never get old. Every time you post one I spend at least five to ten minutes just zooming in studying the moon. Thanks!
---------
Glad I updated to a Gigabit connection at home this morning.
---------
Is there a place where we can download full 400 megapixel file? I'd love to explore this without compression.
---------
Damn, so blurry. Horrible job. 


Just kidding. This is fucking awesome man. Thanks for doing all this work for our viewing enjoyment. Space is fucking crazy.
---------
Oh man, you always...

I have a question. Actually, I have a shitload of questions. But one stands out right now: How do you keep track of 140,000 photos without losing your mind?

Actually, how does *your computer* keep track of 140,000 photos? Do you have a .psd with 140,000 layers? How much RAM do you have?
---------
What is the large dark blue region and why is it a different color
---------
In aboriginal culture we believe that the moon is a man and the Sun female, when the english invader and killed 90 percent of us they used the ancient knowledge to trick the whole world into having faith in the absolute opposite of the truth, ""up is down,down is up and that's how we drink from our cup"" Lewis Carole Alice in wonderland mad hatters tea party. The rabbit whole is deep
---------
Reddit space people, what's the average depth of them craters there?
---------
me, before clicking on it: oh that's nice  
  
me, after clicking on it: oH HOLY SHIT
---------
Moon’s Haunted. 

But seriously incredible pic here good sir!
---------
Wow the moon takes a lot of big pebbles for us
---------
Aaaand my new desktop. Rad. Thank you for your submission
---------
Guess it’s time to update my phone background from last years photo
---------
why not just take a single pic from a high powered cam?
---------
I remember your post last year! I had it as my cover screen on my phone forever, it was absolutely beautiful! Thank you for a lot of smiles!
---------

Do you think Stanley Kubrick is a genius or did we land there... if not why have there been no more moon missions
---------
Can someone please crrate an android wallpaper version of this?

Beautiful. Insane to think that trillions or more galaxies exist in our universe.
---------
**Image Details**

NGC 4565 is an edge-on spiral galaxy about 30 to 50 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices. It lies close to the North Galactic Pole and has a visual magnitude of approximately 10. It is known as the Needle Galaxy for its narrow profile.

If you look closely, many more galaxies can be seen in this picture, one of which is interacting with the Needle Galaxy.

I used 11 hours of exposure time to capture it from my backyard.

 Follow me on Instagram [@chucksastrophotography](https://www.instagram.com/chucksastrophotography/) if you would like to see what's possible to be captured from our own backyard and to see what telescopes I use.

Beautiful photo, but eerily unsettling.

Just knowing the immense unreachable distance another Galaxy is from us - one containing its own island of billions of stars - many of which potentially hosting life. All of that life we will never discover for ourselves locked away in inconceivable isolation.
---------
What do you think they’re thinking about over there?
---------
I wonder if there are aliens in the needle galaxy taking pictures and admiring the milky way galaxy?
---------
Novice question: how does one get 11 hours of night time exposure? Are you staggering it over several nights?
---------
Looking at pictures like this gives me a true sense of awe, that nothing else does.
---------
I refuse to believe that there isn’t intelligent life somewhere in these other galaxies. I bet there so many forms of civilization in our own as well.
---------
Kinda depressing to know that we will never be able to be there
---------
Amazing shot. I assume it was named before we had high enough resolution to realize we're looking at the edge of a disc galaxy?
---------
Somehow seeing the far away galaxies makes me choke up and cry and I have no idea why. Maybe it's just because of the unimaginable distance and the size of the universe. I don't know. I don't want to think about it.
---------
Somewhere there may be a alien species looking up at the stars taking photographs of our galaxy wondering if there is anyone else there.
---------
Here i am unable to bring my aunts face in focus from 5 feet away and your taking this shot from 50 million light years.
---------
50 million years into the past.. wonder if the civilizations that are there are advanced now since taking this picture or did they wipe themselves out..

We will never know
---------
Crazy to think there could possibly be life there; families, emotions, celebrations, and death.
---------
Man what the fuck is even going on out there. I need to know. And I'll never know.
---------
What's crazy is we are looking at it back in time.  It took the light 50 million years to reach the lens so this is of the galaxy 50 million years ago.  

Technically it could have changed dramatically but we cant see because the light from it hasn't reached us yet.
---------
Maybe from their perspective, we're the one's living in the needle-shaped galaxy.
---------
Are the other bright objects surrounding this galaxy other distant galaxies?
---------
Could someone explain to me how this works? Don't know anything about astronomy but how can you take an 11 hour exposure of something that is not stationary in relation to a camera's position on the surface of Earth? Is it actually stationary?
---------
The amount of other galaxies visible in this photo both blows me away and makes my brain hurt.
---------
Every second comment under NASA's Instagram: Nice photoshop, dude.
---------
Its crazy to imagine that what we see here on this picture is basically how the sytem looked millions of years ago. Because of the limitation of the speed of light the system could actually have been blown to pieces and we would never know until many, many years from now!
---------
Even though I read how you did it, I'm stil thinking "... but HOW???!!" This is unbelievable!
---------
"Born too late to explore the world, born too early to explore space" *depression hits*
---------
How many light years would we say that disc (galaxy) is across it's diameter?
---------
Up above the 2nd galaxy appears to be a yellow pair of stars? Is that a binary star system?
---------
I wonder if anyone over there is looking back at the Milkyway galaxy and maybe taking a picture. I mean it's a galaxy, it's got lots of stars. Like in our galaxy there is at least one star with a planet that has us on it and we're taking pictures.
---------
Human beings and most of our recent ancestors didn't even exist when the light captured in that image left that galaxy. Incredible
---------
[removed]
---------
Why is the backyard so important for so many pictures?
---------
How are you guys getting these photos from your backyard?  I’m amazed and imagine it’s an expensive set up of gear.
---------
How does it feel that you have captured a past moment which is billions of light years away
---------
Silly guestion here, but how does someone get these kinds of lengthy exposures without some sort of warp from earth's rotation?
---------
At some point we will see a giant space ship lets say about 25 million light years away.

Day 1: News spreads of an alien space ship 25 million light years away.

Day 2: NASA reports the space ship is now 10 million light years away.

Edit: this comment isn't serious, this is supposed to be an "Oh Shit" joke. Fuckin Chill
---------
Just take a moment to realize that there's definitely a picture of our galaxy sitting somewhere in that galaxy so far away
---------
[removed]
---------
So THATS were needles come from! I always wondered.
---------
Really, really beautiful picture and pretty sharp too! Keep doing what you do! I hope your equipment pays off to you.
---------
Amazing! I understand it took multiple short exposures, but still how did you compensate for the rotation of the Earth? The image is so sharp!
---------
There is one above the big one and two to the left O.o
---------
It's weird to think about the names we give these things and how this looks like a needle to us but from another perspective, it is just like any other galaxy.
---------
Those are neat doubles in the upper right! Is that an illusion of depth? Or are they really right next to each other?
---------
The thing I love most about images like this is to zoom in as much as I can to find other galaxies as well!

It's an amazing picture on it's own, but it has so many hidden secrets! Love it!
---------
I think it’s interesting we call it a needle galaxy because of how it looks (which, obviously), but yet it seems more likely that we just see it from the disc’s side instead of a top/bottom view.
---------
and just think, there may be dinosaur like creatures in there, that since that light left may have become extinct and replaced with creatures like us!
---------
This is the kind of stuff that makes my head swim with emotion, and feels both amazing and depressing at the same time.

On the one hand, it's incredible that there's so much out there. It's amazing to look up at the sky and know that you're seeing so much. But it also feels bad to know I'll almost certainly never get to explore it or learn much more about it.
---------
Why do solar systems in galaxies end up rotating almost on a plane like this?
---------
The clear edges are so fascinating as they show the threshold between being in the galaxy and being condemned to the void.
---------
This is so impressive. We really live in an awesome time that people can capture these images from their back yard
---------
Even if we had a vessel that could travel a light-year a second it would still take 579 days to get there. 😢
---------
I’ve been staring at this thing for ten minutes

Edit: and zooming in...just humbling as hell
---------
Space is simply amazing, well done on the great photo.
---------
This is going to be impossible when there’s millions of Muskellites and Bezosellites in low Earth orbit.
---------
# just... beautiful.

Also if that galaxy died off right now, it would take 50 million years for us to know.
---------
I love it. The other galaxies look great around it as well, so small but so significant as well.
---------
Ah, so it's just edge-on.  That makes sense I guess.
---------
Really beautiful. It's crazy to think there might be life somewhere in that galaxy.  Or that if there is now, we might not see it because the light here is 50 million years old.
---------
I'll never forget seeing this through a 28" Dob at Oregon Observatory back in June, Totally blew my mind as I'm from London,  UK so can count the stars on one hand that I can see with the naked eye.
---------
What setup did you have to account for the Earth's rotation over an 11 hour time span?
---------
Possibly a stupid question. How did you keep the camera targeted for 11 hours? My brain is telling me it shouldn't be possible with the movement of the earth?
---------
Can someone ELI5 how you manage to do an 11-hour exposure without the rotation if the earth messing it up?
---------
Wow, things got controversial in an r/space post? Half the top comments are deleted!
---------
How do you take long exposure photo, of the sky, for that long without getting light trails? Is the camera rigged on something that compensates for the earths rotation?
---------
It never occurred to me that I have no freaking clue how you could do an 11 hour exposure of something millions of lightyears away in space from the constantly moving side of our rotating, sun-orbiting planet....
---------
It's like looking back into history. The galaxy could be long gone and we wouldn't even know it. We're looking at the galaxy as it looked 50 million years ago... That's insane.
---------
This is why I’m always amazed by space photos. Just knowing it takes about eight and half minutes for the light from our own star to get to us is insane. But knowing it took about *50 million years* for that light to get here is on a whole other scale. The great apes, let alone our own species, hadn’t evolved yet when that light was halfway to reaching. 

And yet, there are galaxies even further. It’s so far that’s hard to even process the scale of distance that the universe operates on.
---------
There's probably a couple of dudes sitting in their back yards on their planet in that galaxy wondering what other dudes in other galaxies are doing at that exact moment. I'm pooping, X23422-A
---------
So I have what you will probably consider a really dumb ass question; what is the bright light at the center of the galaxy? I find it hard to believe it’s a super gigantic star, but maybe? I know that within each galaxy are solar systems, but it seems that the galaxy itself revolves around a centerpoint. Sorry if this was just ridiculously elementary.
---------
I wonder how much rotation has happened on that galaxy over the span of the exposure.   In other words,  are we seeing a bunch of motion blur on that galaxy in the final shot?
---------
Space always boggled my mind, coz there's so much we don't know about it
---------
Thank you for allowing us to see such a powerful and breathtaking image. Great eye.
---------
How do you adjust for the Earth’s rotation over such a long exposure time?
---------
50 million light years away. 
Say it fast enough and it slips by. 
But stop to think about how far away it is .... it’s beyond comprehension. 
Yet you got an amazing photo of it. 
Mind blowing. When you stop to think about it. 
Thanks for sharing
---------
Maybe this is a stupid question but how do you keep the camera fixed on one point in Space for 11 hrs. Considering the earth rotates...
---------
Absolutely no chance there's not at least 2 Earths in that.
---------
Know nothing about time exposure photography of the night sky. How can you take an 11 hour exposure with a fixed camera and not have all the stars blurry from earths rotation?
---------
The light you see here, left the galaxy when our planet Earth was still recovering from the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (that wiped 75% away of life, including dinosaurs).
---------
 Can even see other galaxies 😱 wow really that's amazing.
---------
Sure, when you do it you get karma. When I do 11 hours of exposure, I get arrested.
---------
Just think of all the civilizations and intelligent lifeforms that are captured in this one picture.  It is inconceivable that Earth is the **only** planet in the universe that has intelligent life.
---------
So uh, why did mods go absolutely nuclear on a huge comment thread? I checked removeddit and it was a totally normal conversation.
---------
What telescope did you use, because I can hardly see Jupiter’s cloud bands with mine
---------
I mean she does look like if Captain Janeway and chakotay had a baby
---------
Just think, astronauts are allowed a very small amount of personal belongings (by weight) to take with them to the ISS. And this is what she chose.  So awesome.
---------
[There's coffee in that Dragon](https://www.twitter.com/astrosamantha/status/589035429879513088)

Also: source.
---------
Well that is awesome. Taking the cosplay game to a whole new level.
---------
Can you imagine the person who went through her luggage before launch.
 “Is this a voyager starfleet uniform?” 

“Yes.”

“You know I cant let you take the communicator  badge.”

“Come on......”
---------
Its gotta take courage to wear a red shirt in space.
---------
She’s a really dedicated cosplayer. Became an astronaut for the perfect instagram background
---------
I’d like to take a moment to notice the subtle curvature of the Earth there.
---------
Thinking about it, I'm kind of surprised she's the first to do this.
---------
I thought the timecorps would prevent this kind of stuff.  Letting UFP officers travel around IN UNIFORM.  Slacking on the job they are.
---------
This is quite possibly the peak of our civilization right here lmao
---------
[removed]
---------
Proud to be Italian as Samantha Cristoforetti and Luca Parmitano 🇮🇹
---------
Eat your hearts out, Instagrammers. Imagine the lifetime of dedication and hard work it took Cristoforetti to get within striking distance of this shot.
---------
Let's face it - the Italians know how to dress.
---------
If you're going to go all the way to space then you might as well buy the Comm Badge too.
---------
It is wild to think that some time in the future we'll have a dedicated fleet that explores, and colonizes space.
---------
Just out of the frame is her colleague who spent the whole mission dressed as Chewbacca
---------
So she’s officially the first person to boldly go where no one has gone before (appropriately dressed)
---------
Oh man this is fantastic 

Also that telescope awesome
---------
NASA needs to adopt those uniforms as standard issue. 

Make it so.
---------
This is going to confuse the crap out of some archaeologist someday.
---------
Shouldn’t she be wearing a science uniform?

I’m sorry
---------
Alright, nerds. Tell us which one this uniform is from and then explain why it's not accurate.
---------
And what's cool about that it looks like a trek uniform from Voyager!!!
---------
As an Italian woman, I am so fucking proud of this lady.
---------
And she chose a fucking red one?

&#x200B;

Madlass.
---------
Oh hey, it's Captain Janeway. 

&#x200B;

HOW ABOUT YOU BLOW UP THE ARRAY WITH A REMOTE BOMB INSTEAD OF STRANDING YOUR FUCKING CREW IN THE DELTA QUADRANT YOU FUCK??
---------
Nice!  A DS9 uniform!


I could never get into that show, but this is so fucking meta.  Mad respect to the level of cosplay commitment.
---------
If we keep going the right way it will become standard issu, finger cross.
---------
If I was an astronaut and woke up on the ISS to see someone in a Star Fleet uniform, I'd probably have some very confusing moments.
---------
This is absolutely the most brilliant thing I think I’ve ever seen. I don’t know how to even process this... I think I’m just going to keep this picture on my phone and look at it whenever I feel sad or stressed.
---------
I swear I saw Janeway when I scrolled past this post
---------
That’s a DS9 uniform with non standard purple undershirt. It’s even more badass. 

Also I can’t believe nobody has done this before. The $1000 it probably cost to get that uniform in space was worth every penny.
---------
Wasn't this from 2015? I've seen this about 7 times today.
---------
Easily one of the coolest pictures I've ever seen.
---------
You do realise this was over 4 years ago? Not really news, was well covered at the time
---------
Game over. Pack it up ladies, No other trekkie will be able to match this cosplay. Not even the ones that dress all scandalous.
---------
Isn’t that a violation of Star fleet protocol?
---------
Noticing that you failed to see anything out of place until you read the title is the first step in acknowledging you have a Sci-fi problem.
---------
Awesome pic, just add audio with the star date and “this is the Captian’s log...”
---------
I hope she has a yellow one for the engineering jobs
---------
Welp...looks like they screwed up this timeline.
---------
Red, that's a commanders' uniform right? Does she have that rank?
---------
How do they keep warm on the ISS? Do they have space heaters?
---------
Ensign Hickman really does do a passable Janeway
---------
"Live long and prosper" commander Samantha Cristoforetti!
---------
I love this. She is awesome. People are awesome.
---------
Captain Janeway IRL. I hope they have coffee up there.
---------
Wasn't this four years ago? Or was that someone else?

Edit: typo
---------
This makes me think, when the technology is there, will there be to-scale recreations of famous sci-fi starships? Like will there be a bunch of Enterprises and Millennium Falcons flying around?
---------
She looks ready to get some synthale and visit the holosuite at quarks
---------
I love space and seeing how much of a great time she’s having out there puts a smile on my face! :)
---------
i just saw another post about this and it was 2015?
---------
I wonder how much that cost to bring it up there
---------
Lieutenant, 0.000025498974673  warp speed. 

Engage
---------
Can someone convert the weight of the uniform into money spend on fuel?
---------
just gonna add this to the memory bank of amazing things in history to collide
---------
Could the next astronaut do Jedi Robes and a lightsaber, or is that asking too much?
---------
Its red tho. Doesnt that mean she finna die first
---------
Awesome, although the combadge is off, I assume that is the ISS badge
---------
The secret here is she actually is a Starfleet officer from the future and those are her normal clothes.
---------
I had a Janegasm.  JK, she's awesome and doesn't need a tv show to be awesome but even more awesome for picking Janeway and/or any of the strong female officers on ST.
---------
I wonder if she would go up to a sleeping crew member and get someone else to say something loud like, "captain, we found this ship floating in space, and judging by what we found, it seems to have been floating in stasis since the early 21st century." and just appear right in front of that crew member just as they're waking up.
---------
Now this is the kind of “women in space” shit we all need to hear about

Fucking awesome and how legit does that uniform look
---------
I was scrolling through Reddit, watching Voyager on Netflix.  Looked down from captain Janeway, saw this, and did like a tripple-take back and forth.  Never been so momentarily confused by media multi-tasking.
---------
Captain Samantha Christoforetti makes a kick-arse Kathryn Janeway!
---------
I don’t know why - but just seeing he uniform actually being worn in space is incredibly comforting
---------
Why would she wear red? Redshirts have the worst history and are somewhat of a meme for dying early.
---------
As geeky as it sounds I would just love to see actual scifi inspired aesthetics in reality. Like storm trooper armor for the military, or a space ship that looks like the millennium falcon, or space helmets similar to mass effect's design.
---------
Wow, this woman looks like that other female astronaut in the news a while ago, Anne McClain. Apparently you need a square jaw to be a female astronaut. I wonder if they put that on the application.
---------
thats just awesome!
---------
She’s got serious guts wearing a red shirt in space
---------
Should have sprung for the FC upgrade. The early-DS9/Voyager jumpsuits didn't age well.
---------
This is like a video game company running an ad for a new game before it comes out
---------
Anyone else think it's funny AF that the first female space walk was cancelled over wardrobe problems?
---------
Is she the one who stole her wife’s identity while in orbit?
---------
We really should just have a sub for kick-ass photos like this
---------

Would you mind telling me how you were able to take the pictures?
---------
From top to bottom:The sun, Uranus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, the ISS, Comet 46P/Wirtanen, Venus, and the Moon. Each taken using basic amateur equipment.   

For more of this stuff, and the original pictures, here's a shameless instagram plug ;) [cosmic\_background](https://www.instagram.com/cosmic_background/)

\*Not to scale
---------
My dad has some very high powered binoculars. The first time i used them to look at Jupiter on clear night it blew my mind. You could even see 2 of Jupiter’s moons. We used an app called sky guide to pinpoint the exact location of things in the sky. Highly recommend the app. 
---------
This is where dedication and patience get you. Thanks a lot for sharing this. You should also show this to your neighbours. They might have been wondering about the weird telescope guy in his backyard for a while now.
---------
Didn't even take a picture of the earth smh/s
---------
How'd you get the ISS so clearly? Doesn't it moving really fast screw it up?
---------
How did you manage to take a picture of Uranus?(Pun not intended) you must have a pretty powerful telescope
---------
Scrolling on my phone i thought this was buttons on a blouse until i got to the bottom. Neat pic!
---------
I didn't know that we can see these planets like this
---------
If you add your garden to the bottom you'll have earth too
---------
I spent 5 minutes looking for Earth, not my proudest moment
---------
This is pretty amazing. But, I had no idea the moon was that big. 
---------
May I save this and use it as a wallpaper on my phone?
---------
 getting some pretty big 2001a space odyssey vibes from this 
---------
Wait, this is my phone wallpaper. Are you the same guy who made that last week?

EDIT: I see you are!
---------
Can you make a 1440p version for desktop looks dope
---------
fake news, I don't think the moon is THAT close to jupiter. 
---------
The Moon looks so crisp! Like I could reach out and touch it. I hope to view it in a telescope one day.
---------
If there’s one thing I’ve learned from all the movies I’ve watched it’s that if everything were to really come into alignment like this we’d be fuuuuuuuucked. 

Also, nice pic!
---------
I refuse to acknowledge any collection of planets as "our solar system" unless it includes our fallen brother Pluto.

This work, however, is insanely impressive, and you should be proud.
---------
When I first looked at this, I thought it was a person wearing a cardigan with planet buttons.
---------
This really makes me want to get a telescope. My grandpa bought an old beginner one when I was younger and we always planned on sitting out the back garden with it. It's been 15 years and we still haven't gotten round to it. Really want to get hold of a good telescope this year and surprise him on his birthday but I have absolutely no idea on where to start. If anyone has any advice it'd be greatly appreciated! 

Also awesome job OP!
---------
If you only look at the top 3/4 of this pic it looks like a girls blouse with really fancy buttons.
---------
That’s incredible. You should be fucking proud man
---------
Hey OP. You posted this a while ago and I've had it as my wallpaper ever since. Much thanks
---------
I saw saturn with a telescope, in a backyard 2 years ago.

Anyone who has not seen a planet with your own eye, I highly recommend it.

It is a much more surreal experience than any picture could give you.


---------
This might be my favorite reddit post. This is awesome.
---------
Hard to get a good shot of Mercury. Too much light.
---------
This has got to be in the top 10 coolest images I've ever seen.
---------
Can I please move in to your backyard? You won't even know I'm there. 
---------
All the planets are out of order, and I'm guessing the bright blue spot 3rd from bottom is the Artificial Singularity
---------
Is that moon picture really yours? What "entry level" camera or telescope can i get to see the moon that well? 
---------
that spaceship is where their control centre is, theyre controlling us from there
---------
Not impressed at all, now if op also got planet earth in the shot from their backyard that would be something /s
---------
Nice photo first of all but would someone mind to explain me why these planets look so fakish on the photo?
---------
I don't want to bombard you with questions, but this is something that interests me. I've not attempted it before.

I have a 14" Meade LX-200 GPS, which is pretty old. I'm wondering if it would be good enough for astrophotography.

Any opinion?
---------
Just gave you all the karma I possibly could. 

This is awesome. 
---------
Am i the only one who heard 2001: A space odyssey theme play? 
---------
Really cool and thanks for sharing! How come you didn't take a picture of the Earth, though?
---------
Fucking excellent! You should consider submitting this to a competition.
---------
This is amazing, Artistic and unique! 𝑪𝑶𝑵𝑮𝑹𝑨𝑻𝑺 on your achievement! 👍
---------
This is really gorgeous. Love the composition as well.
---------
This is amazing! Awesome work on this, i always appreciate great photos of space and the universe we live in. Crazy... thanks for sharing this. I'm definitely saving this if you don't mind!
---------
Could you share the individual pictures of the planets?
---------
Now all we need is a giant mirror in space to get a selfie.
---------
This is incredible. The picture of the ISS is particularly impressive.  Fantastic work, consider me awestruck. 
---------
I also took a picture of Comet 46P awhile back, and yours is processed beautifully!
---------
This is exactly why I log into reddit everyday. Hoping to see a post such as this to be inspired. Thank you for sharing these with us. 
---------
which part of this fine planet is your backyard at?
---------
I'd like to propose "*blop blop blop*" for the name of the picture.
---------
Very nice. This will stay on my phone's screen now :) 
---------
Thanks for the new background art for my phone! 
---------
Amazing OP! Please send this pic to Astronomy Magazine and see if they'll publish it.
---------
Why's that planet in the middle not round shaped?
---------
Can we just take a moment and appreciate how unique our solar system looks
---------
So that’s where Doctor Strange hid the time stone.
---------
Amazing Talent. So when does the space baby show up?
---------
Hey I'm not going to lie,I thought this was a t-shirt! It'd make a pretty trippy design I think!
---------
How very cool of you  


Thanks for sharing  


Awesome!!!   


The universe experiencing, and photographing, itself
---------
The traveler is going to start terraforming the moon. 
---------
If the ISS is bigger than Jupiter, how come we can't see it with our naked eyes?
---------
What was it like seeing these planets with your own eyes for the first time? I hope one day I can see them for myself!
---------
I just realized I've seen pictures of planets but never the ISS
---------
Great comp! Saving and claiming the source (you) for later!
---------
I remember the first time I saw Saturn through a telescope, I was pretty high and when we got focus on the planet I could see the gap between the ring and the planet and it absolutely blew my mind, it was very humbling in a way and I'll never forget it. 
---------
This is beyond words to me.  Most wonderful thing I have seen, especially I like space. Great work. 
---------
I am sorry sir. None of those planets are flat. You took the pictures wrong.

/s
---------
Seeing Jupiter though a telescope for the first time is a huge eye opening experience for me!
---------
There is a super blood moon coming january 21st i believe, it would be awesome if you got a picture if that.
---------
What is the glowing blue object 3rd from the bottom. 
---------
Pretty unbelievable you can clearly make out the Great Red Spot in the image of Jupiter. What a fucking storm that must be...it’s larger than Earth.
---------
Incredible work. Feel proud of yourself in your photographing, concept, and execution.
---------
This is a beautiful photo, but I had a brief second where I didn't realise where I was, and I thought this was a funky cardigan with the planet's for buttons. 
---------
Please can we have an external link with a full resolution file? This is too stunning to be admired damaged by the compressing algorithm of reddit!
---------
Getting ready to teach about the Apollo moon landings and space. Anyone got some cool websites, images, facts, or really anything that would help explain gravity - distance between planets - Apollo 11 - mars? 
---------
I remember the first time I saw a planet through a telescope. It was a smaller, personal telescope of a kid I went to school with. I wasn’t really friends with him but he let me look through his telescope anyway. He already had it aligned with Saturn and oh. my. god. It blew me away. The beauty of what was just a small bright speck absolutely blew me away.  It sparked my love of astronomy and the stars. The fact that, from 746 *million* miles (1.2bn km) and with a small personal telescope, you can see the rings around Saturn still amazes me, more than a decade later 
---------
Aurora Borealis!? At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen!?
---------
Is it weird that I'm upset about the lack of Pluto in this pic? I know its not technically considered a planet but....come on...its a fucking planet in our hearts.
---------
I’m very confused, are these actual shots of what the planets look like through a telescope?

Man, I really need to use one. It blows my mind.
---------
This is one of the best bits of OC I've ever seen on Reddit.
---------
This deserves some sort of reward. Epic. Good job! 
---------
Just found my new wallpaper for my phone. Thanks!
---------
Hey u/ajamesmccarthy do you have an online store where you’re selling hi-res prints of this? Cuz I would definitely buy one for my room! 
---------
Thanks OP for sharing this photo with us. It is truly wonderful
---------
This is inspiring. As an amateur photographer for 10 years and a telescope enthusiast, seeing this makes me want to take it more seriously and have a beautiful and impressive piece for my home walls. Nothing is more satisfying to hang up on your walls than one of your own creations (so long as you’re modest about it of course).

Great work man. I especially love that the ISS is in there as a visual size gauge.
---------
This would be great as an [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/apsubmit2015.html) photo.
---------
I believe I have just found my new phone wallpaper. Thank you, good sir!
---------
Now I have 'Also sprach Zarathustra' running through my head
---------
I had a dream once I was on another planet (that doesn’t exist) and I could see Jupiter up close. This gigantic massive planet made of caramel swirls spinning right in front of me. That vision was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life and I probably ever will. That was 14 months ago. I will never forget. Thank you for showing me what Jupiter would look like from my own backyard. It would be cool seeing it again. <3
---------
Holy fuck bud this is some of the best amateur astrophotography I've seen. Very good work. Much much better than anything I've managed. 
---------
You took these?? Wow this is absolutely beautiful. Definitely my wallpaper now, if you don't mind!
---------
I know this will get buried but this is, **legitimately**, the coolest shits I have seen, *in my life*, and I applaud both your effort and determinism.

Keep doing whatever it is you are doing, because you make the world a better place with your work. 
---------
Awesome photos! It's incredible you can see that level of detail. I'm a little confused at how there is a half-Mars illuminated though. I thought that could only happen when an object gets between the Earth and the sun and you can see the half facing away from the sun....like with Venus or the moon.
---------
I loved this so much I set my lock screen with it. Any way to throw some coin your way??  This is awesome!
---------
What is between the ISS and the comet? What star is that?
---------
My favorite new phone background. Thanks dude. Beautiful work. 
---------
My 4 year old loves this, wants it in their room and now wants a telescope. You have fed an already big love of space. 
---------
Just made this my iPhone home screen background. Aligns perfectly between the icons. Also if you zoom in to the top middle then double tap to zoom out it creates a cool 3D illusion. Nice work op. 
---------
This is insane.

Just want to thank you for my new phone background.
---------
Absolutely stunning, wish I had the equipment to do these types of things
---------
Space fascinates the shit out of me, but also terrifies me at the same time. 
---------
the satellite looks like a Terran Viking in airship mode
---------
OP.. I cans seriously relate to how chuffed you must be with this image.  I ad the joy of seeing Shumaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter from my backyard with a 4” reflector. It looked much like it does in tour image with a string of pearls moving towards it.   I have seen a million amazing images since then, but nothing compares to having seen it and done it myself with my own eyes... so this collage must be like 100x that... at least!   Nicely done.

and yeah... my wife had HUGE issues tracking the moon with a radio telescope array... they just are not designed to track objects orbiting Earth, so I am really curious about you methodology for ISS.. was it really manual plus many exposures as it crossed your frame?
---------
At first I saw it as a lady wearing a black shirt with buttons
---------
I thought this was the bottom of a face wearing a black shirt with the planets as buttons

---------
I thought this was buttons on a woman's shirt when I was scrolling
---------
thankyou for the best phone lock screen I've had in ages..
---------
Found my new phone wallpaper, this is awesome! thanks OP.
---------
I have tried photographing Saturn before but I never got anything near as good as what you got. It was still an amazing thing to see though, was pretty awe-inspiring as it's pretty much invisible to the eye so seeing it's rings "live" was a humbling moment. This is great work. :-)
---------
On behalf of the OPA, I demand you take photos of Ceres station! :)
---------
This is dope. It makes me want one of those 10" telescopes and a heavy $1.000 camera. It's quite facinating to look at.
---------
The fact that they're not in order upsets me, but the quality of the images soothes me.
---------
This is obviously a fake, I don't see Earth anywhere
---------
Wow.  I feel like that ISS photo isn’t getting as much credit as it deserves.    Also the overall composition is really nice to look at.   Excellent work. 
---------
Would it possible to take a photo of someone in front of the moon so that you could distinguishe the person to who it actually is? (I.e the photo not Being to blurry).
---------
That's pretty awesome. I have always wanted to own a telescope to view things at such mind boggling distance away. Nice work. Very creative.
---------
I wish I had gold to give you. Thank you for this! 
---------
Just wanted to say this is my homescreen on my phone now and I love how the planets line up perfectly between the apps on my phone


---------
I’m looking to get a telescope for myself. Can you recommend the one you’re using? What brand and mounts? What’s the magnification?
---------
That's amazing work, I've yet to capture the ISS :(
---------
Wow, that is a really cool compilation of photos. The clarity is unreal and very vivid. Thanks for sharing.
---------
That's a damn fine piece of astronomic art.  You should be very proud.

---------
Thanks for the new wallpaper for my cell! Gorgeous composition, btw.
---------
weird looking planet you got there below Mars
---------
[removed]
---------
Are all of these images taken with the same magnification? It seems convenient that Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the ISS are all the same apparent size basically, but then same applies to the moon and the sun...
---------
I'm such a dumbass I thought this was a shirt and the top was a neckhole and the buttons were planets. 
---------
I was about to ask where Earth is. Never mind. 
---------
I don't see Earth in the solar system. Why isn't Earth in your photo collection?
---------
What is that 3rd object from the Moon?
I hope you have a hires photo of this, would love to have it as my wallpaper!
---------
Wow, I never knew the window was so small, gives me much more appreciation for these kind of shots. Thanks!
---------
The crazy part is that the moon is 239,000 miles away and the ISS is only 250 miles away.
---------
This is one of the best ISS captures I've seen. Resolution is really good!
At 10 fps, were you able to get 2 shots of the station?

---------
Since the ISS is at a height of 420 km, two people 4 km apart would see the space station at different sides of the moon if they looked at it simultaneously.
---------
Sometimes I sit back and can barely grasp that we've build an intricately complex structure going at almost 7.7 km/s in an orbit around earth that enables people to live in an environment otherwise completely hostile to pretty much any life for elongated periods of time. What a beautiful combined work of humankind.

And we still have so much more to do, so much farther to go.
---------
Well done, I'd say the window would be even smaller since you managed to take a picture with the ISS away from those dark basalt seas!
---------
That's no moon... 

But seriously amazing picture!
---------
I didn't know TIE fighters could reach this system.
---------
That's an amazing shot mate! I wish I could get a high resolution version of it so I can put it as my background!
---------
Our satellites look so good together. Great photo.
---------
That ISS amazing! 

Sorry for the bad joke, but that's actually awesome and it really depicts how small we are here, great picture!
---------
Did you press the button on the camera to take the photo or did you set up some sort of timer to take the photo automatically at a certain time?
---------
Some may say it looks like a smudge on a lense
---------
Fasted shutter finger in the West (I’m sure it was remote triggered but don’t take this from me Jerry!)
---------
What a perspective... big things for small mans
---------
And people wonder why you can’t build a telescope big enough to see the LMs on the moon. The ISS is about 400 km above the photographer, and the moon is about 400,000km above. The area of the ISS is bigger than the entire area Apollo 11 ventured on the moon. Now shrink the ISS is this picture by a factor of 1000x and you get an idea. The Zarya module on ISS is about the size of the LM.
---------
One should never cross the full moon. He’s a vengeful soul.
---------
Boy that's way faster than I would've guessed.
---------
I just wonder how much it should be gigantic at low lunar orbit to appear the same.
---------
That's a great capture, mate! Breathtaking! Will check out your site now.
---------
Welp, that's good enough to dethrone my current desktop background :)
---------
And yet we can't get an decent picture of a UFO that's hovering
---------
Imagine one day, our grand children’s grand children will look at the sky and they wont see the same moon because somewhere on the surface will be a small city just barely visible with the naked eye. And their grandchildren’s grandchildren will look up and see a sprawling metropolis on the surface of the moon.
---------
With that resolution, would it have been possible to photograph a person doing a spacewalk at the station?
---------
"Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves."

---------
Anyone else feel like it lasted that long either
---------
Amazing pic! And I am a bit awed by your patience and persistence to be able to catch something with a .58 minute window!
---------
What's the best way to focus when shooting something like this? Is focusing on a bright star a way to go?
---------
I thought the ISS would be much bigger by 2020. Like a small version of DS9. 

We should have a pub in space by 2050 - that should be humanity’s goal for the next 30 years. 

Irish pub, obviously.
---------
Wow! This is a wonderful picture.  Great work.

<sarcasm>Must be using the eVscope!</sarcasm>
---------
When ever I see posts of the moon, my head instantly thinks hey that's not your photo!, I saw some one else post that. But then I remember every picture of the moon is the same
---------
It's still hard me to fathom that we have a literal floating space station. Like the amount of cooperation to pull that off should really be a bigger deal than it is. I hope there are more space stations in the works.
---------
From a certain angle, some people would say he looked like a smudge.
---------
It is absolutely mind blowing how fast that little bastard zips across the sky. Full earth orbits in like an hour and a half constantly all the time. The fact that we have a thing just doing a constant 17,000 mph at the edge of space is something I feel like we shouldn't have been able to accomplish but did nonetheless.
---------
Okay.  I thought I was nuts at the time -but- I was looking through my telescope at the Moon and something transited - this was over a year ago.  From the silhouette, I figured it was the Hubble, but looking at your photo, it damn well may have been the ISS.  Heh.
---------
This reminds me of The Expanse's opening theme
---------
I tought that you capture right moment when TieFighter was close to the moon
---------
One night my son and I were looking through our telescope at the Moon and saw an irregular shape moving across our lense in a straight line. To my eye it looked like the double triangle of a fast forward.  It was moving too fast to be on the moon's surface and too slow to be a satellite. I checked the lense and had my son quickly look through and he had seen it too. I was freaking out trying to figure out what we had just seen. After Googling for a while the next day I came across a photo of the same thing we saw where someone had captured a rare shot of the space station moving in front of the Moon. The photo was not as clear as this amazing shot you see here. Once I figured out what happened I was in awe that we got the chance to see it purely by accident.
---------
Holy crap, someone spent 10,000 coins to give the Milky way award.

I don't even know if I have money to buy 10,000 coins.
---------
This happened to me the very first night I used a brand new telescope. Completely by accident. 

I absolutely couldn't believe my luck, and I'm glad you were able to capture exactly what I saw!
---------
I am completely baffled as to why ANYONE would downvote this. This image is fracking amazing.
---------
I have a guy at work that doesn't believe we've ever been to space!! Not just the moon but not in space at all. I showed him a very similar pic a while ago and he said it's clearly photoshoped. Dude is such a lost cause.
---------
This is brilliant!  One of the clearest transit photos I've ever seen. 

Great work and shows you’re not just “that guy that takes the beautiful launch photos”.
---------
This is so such an aesthetically simple photo yet so amazing I can’t stop looking at it
---------
So you guys mean to tell me that space IS real?!?!?!
---------
You're a *lunatic*.
Puns intended.
On the bright side though, this is a very lovely photo✨
---------
Fantastic shot.    My brother took this pic last year and it has the silhouette of a satellite in it.    It seems to me that if you had a network of cameras pointing at the moon you could eventually inventory every satellite out there and figure out each orbit.     [https://i.imgur.com/ZGDRb0C.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZGDRb0C.jpg)
---------
The coolest part of it all, is that the ISS is only roughly 400km away in this shot, and yet it's about 384,000km from the moon.
---------
Anyone else thinking of the Rick and morty episode with the grinning guy on the moon?
---------
This maybe a stupid question but is the station closer to us or the moon in this picture?
---------
I swear I’ve seen almost this exact photo before, have you taken a similar photo to this in the past or has somebody else taken one just like this recently?
---------
That's incredible. I guess timing is everything
---------
tHiS Is AcTuAlLy PhOtOsHoPpEd So BaDlY hOw Do YoU nOt SeE tHiS
---------
This is my favorite picture so far, I love how clear you can see the ISS. Great work!
---------
Thank you for sharing this awesome image with us!
---------
How many months did you wait for it to pass over the middle of the moon? I think i would have driven myself mad checking the weather forecast as the date approached.
---------
I bet you took multiple exposures too, you master minded villain.

that's insane
---------
That is incredible! How did you figure out the timing window to get the ISS in the shot?
---------
When you look at the night sky it's crazy how many satellites you can count now.
---------
How often is this possible? I remember the post you took 2 years ago where the space station was visible.
---------
Nice! I zoomed in just to see if someone was waving at us behind a window...
---------
Wow I thought the iss was smaller than that, compared to the moon
---------
How come we never see satellites flying across the moon?
---------
Love love love it!!! I use the ISS app to watch for it whenever I can.
---------
What an amazing photo. Just showed my son and he agrees. Phenomenal stuff.
---------
I like looking at the moon.  Thank you for sharing.
---------
What, no Venus occluding Mercury in the background??
---------

---------
I just saw this on your Instagram as I was scrolling through my feed! Weirded me out seeing it here. Awesome picture though! 
---------
[removed]
---------
Unfortunately I woke up too late this morning and missed the livestream, but it looks like it went off without any major hitches. I feel bad for Cygnus (the spacecraft being launched), as it always seems to play second fiddle to SpaceX's Dragon resupply craft. You'd figure with those neat looking solar arrays it would garner a little more attention.
---------
These pictures can be so hard to get with cancellations and everything so I'm really happy for you all four butts were able to make it. 
---------
After careful consideration,  I have to agree with your decision to focus on the rocket and not on those butts.  
---------
[removed]
---------
Super disappointed with the weather.  I was on my roof in DC and couldn't see a damn thing.  Would have been great visibility if the launch hadn't been scrubbed yesterday.
---------
[removed]
---------
I have family on Chincoteague and visit often but never seen a launch. Where are you allowed to be for this/best viewing for one?
---------
So I've got the cloud to butt extension on one of my computers, but not the other. 

Spent about 30 seconds trying to find 4 clouds in the picture.
---------
Ah man I drove 2 hours to see it yesterday and it was aborted because an aircraft was flying too close. 
---------
What time was this photo taken? 
---------
[removed]
---------
Technically that bird has a butt so you took a picture of at least 5 butts.
---------
The man is standing the perfect distance away to not be associated with the other three. No joke he knows what he's doing. Just an inch closer and it would been a group of 4. Now that's true art right there
---------
/u/TMahlman Here you go! Honestly, if I gave it a couple more hours I could make it look flawless. 

https://i.imgur.com/8dzQA2P.png
---------
You couldn't walk in front of the butts to take the picture?
---------
Not great, butts are out of focus.  Better luck next time!
---------
So in other words,  you woke up at the butt crack of dawn.
---------
Is it just the perspective or are these people way too close to the rocket?
---------

4 butts and a rocket sounds like a porno I couldn't help but watch
---------
Holy shit! I’m from Indiana. Graduated from Purdue and was also in chincoteaque this morning to see the launch! I wasn’t this close but I was on the island and watched it from a fishing dock. Small world. 
---------
Would have been really funny if your camera focused on the butts instead of the rocket.
---------
I feel like there should be a caption with the word “asstronauts” used to describe the individuals in the photo.

Is there a 3 AM that doesn’t exist in the morning?

I live in brevard amd had no idea there was a launch last night. I need to start putting these on a calendar or something.

Covering the Orbital ATK OA-8 resupply launch to the Space Station this morning, I realized that all the photographers (me included) were lined up in one spot and would all result with the same photo. I decided to move back for a different view of the launch.

This is awesome! I'm jealous though! I lived on Chincoteague and my dad worked at Wallops from 1999-2003. My dad still goes to Wallops a few times a year for testing, he's seen them launch rockets a few times.
---------
Is there a website that lets you know when you can view one of these launches? I️ feel like it would be one of the most amazing things I have ever watched in person. 
---------
Nice one dude! Keep making us Boilermakers proud! Boiler up!
---------
I'm guessing the rocket launch was just a coincidence 
---------
I live ocean side an hour south and watched from our deck. Was able to see for a few seconds before it disappeared behind clouds. The really cool part was the loud launch boom we heard and felt about 3 minutes later. Too bad it was scrubbed yesterday. Would have been perfect. And I'll take the cold over the mosquitos that feasted on me during the color rocket launch (and scrubbed attempts) and other payload launch this summer! Must have been a true thrill to be as close as you were.
---------
[deleted]
---------
I live on the eastern shore a handful of miles away from this.  Seeing wallops pop up on the front page humbles me. People drive hours to see what I can literally see from my back yard. 
---------
It's really lucky that you were able to find those things when you wanted them, would have been a disappointing day for you if there were only 3 butts there for example, you'd of spent the day line "gahhhh can't believe I was one butt short of my ideal photo, maybe tomorrow I'll get it"
---------
Is it always that light at 3 am or was that cause by the rocket fire thing.

Glorious. This is on my Bucket list to see a launch in person. 

Hope i get to see it one day!
---------
Wow, where did you shoot this from? We ended up on some old dock/pier about 2 miles from the pad. One of my shots: https://i.imgur.com/kjWrDbS.jpg

It seems like it would have been pretty easy to change your position so that you didn’t have the rocket in the frame.  Just sayin’
---------
Imagine this picture being taken and the people in the foreground are family members of an astronaut going to mars in the rocket. Its like he is still in the picture.

Well done Trevor. Now is the part where you give people a link to your Patreon page so you can take butt pics full time.
---------
I don't know why but this feels like a painting for Fallout. Do you have a desktop sized version I could use as a background? I love it
---------
I honestly wonder, did you set up a shot, only for 4 people to stand in your frame like absolute slobs? 
---------
I'm sure there's an adult film out there somewhere with the same title.
---------
4 butts and a rocket... pretty sure I watched something similar last night. 
---------
They have no shape to their bodies.... just 3 plain jane mofo's blocking a good photo op lol
---------
whats the sunset time at your place? its very bright at 3am o.O
---------
4 butts and a rocket was Elton Johns best album 
---------
I don't always take pictures, but when I do the ass to rocket ratio must be exactly 4:1
---------
You forgot to mention the bird and the aeroplane

---------
I feel like the butts add to the pic! Shows how public interest is still there for the space program which is crucial. Great work OP!
---------
Its very uplifting and exciting that Americans are finally venturing forth into space again. We truly need to explore as a species to keep us from destroying one another. I am hoping this new dawn of space exploration averts humanities attention from war and political turmoil into a unified look upwards. Our most ancient ancestors who built the most lasting and monumental civilisations spent their energies looking up, perhaps we can reach that splendor again.
---------
I as well woke up late. Phenomenal shot. Good job bud!
---------
Rocket butt, burning out his fuse up here alone
---------
It looks like if you’d have zoomed out a bit you may have gotten a 5th butt. 
---------
I live in South Florida and have never seen a launch. Can anyone tell me when the next launch like this will be and where I have to be to see it as close as these people?
---------
 I can just imagine you laying in bed excited about the rocket launch and the 4 butts you’ll photograph later. 
---------
Nice photo! Where were you standing? I have been there twice to look and last time I bought VIP tickets. I would still need a crazy lens to get that close shot!?!
---------
"The rocket lay on the launching field, blowing out pink clouds of fire and oven heat. The rocket stood in the cold winter morning, making summer with every breath of its mighty exhausts. The rocket made climates, and summer lay for a brief moment upon the land..." 
---------
A quick trip to /r/photoshoprequest/ will render you buttless, if that is your desire.

---------
'Ah yes beautiful butts. Wait that rocket is cool. I'll upload it on reddit.'
---------
It's actually cool. Gives it a context and looks more unique then all the other rocket photos
---------
I know a guy that has satellites going up on that!
---------
My mom works for Orbital-ATK. She was at the launch of the Minotaur-C last month.  She said it was “thrilling”.  
---------
How was that airplane on the right cleared to be so close to the launch?? 
---------
That must be cool to watch the rocket take off. I can imagine the awesomeness as you hear the rocket taking off, the roaring of the thrusters fighting gravity and pushing this massive object into the sky, also the feeling of the wind of it even your so far away. I am real jelly of you at the moment  thank you for sharing this epic pic. How many time did you experience this?
---------
So Jealous! I keep missing the Wallops Island launches. The one time I drove all the way there, they canceled it right before we arrived. 
---------
They missed an opportunity to do the OH-IO thing with the rocket as the I, of course.
